# Flow Working Groups test

Flow believes in the power of community-driven, collaborative problem-solving and is committed to involving this process in shaping its future.
To achieve this, Flow has established a series of Technical Working Groups, each dedicated to a crucial aspect of the Flow ecosystem.
The motivation is to harness the collective wisdom, insights, and expertise of the diverse Flow community to make informed decisions that align with the community's needs and the network's growth.

## Working groups

Flow has the following active working groups:

1. **[User Experience Working Group](./user_experience_working_group)**: Focuses on enabling developers to craft exceptional user experiences within the Flow ecosystem.


2. **[Wallet Working Group](./wallet_working_group)**: Aims to promote and exemplify the unique product possibilities for wallets on Flow, while establishing best-in-class wallet user experience and security standards, to enable developers to build compelling applications on Flow.


3. **[Defi Working Group](./defi_working_group)**: Focuses on all the Defi initiatives on Flow.


4. **[Cadence Language Design Working Group](./cadence_language_design_working_group)**: Focuses on Flow's Smart Contract programming language (Cadence) and itâ€™s execution environment.


5. **[Core Protocol Working Group](./core_protocol_working_group)**: Focuses on Flowâ€™s future-proof architecture and efficiently scaling without compromising decentralization and composability.


6. **[Governance Working Group](./governance_working_group)**: Focuses on community governance, protocol parameters, node operations and tokenomics.


These six groups cover all the major streams of work. Some groups have sub-committees within, to focus on specific topics under the main stream of work.

The working group goal is to drive their respective topic where members contribute towards ideation, research, designs and implementation of several initiatives under that topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Everyone** is invited to join these working groups as per their areas of interest.

## How to join a working group?

Each working group meets at a regular cadence. The meetings are public and **anyone** can join.
