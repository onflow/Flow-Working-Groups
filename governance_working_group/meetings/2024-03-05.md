- **SUMMARY:** The Flow Governance Working Group gathered on March 5th (Tuesday), commencing with a discussion on the fundamental principles of Flow governance, which include Tokenomics, participatory decision-making, and network operations. Both short-term and long-term objectives of the working group were deliberated upon, focusing on optimizing inflation, enhancing Flow utility, and fostering community-driven selection of node operators in the near term, and integrating on-chain voting, optimal treasury allocation and democratic appointment of  leadership in the long term.  Updates were provided on the current Tokenomics OKRs of the Flow Foundation, particularly regarding the determination of Tokenomics for FlowEVM, transaction fees, inflation reduction, etc. The meeting concluded with a reminder to stay updated on working group activities, to actively contribute to the agenda, and to share ideas on key initiatives such as inflation reduction and enhancing the efficacy of these working groups.
