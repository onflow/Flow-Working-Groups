Transcript
Ali Serag: You have the power. So A couple big announcements.
Tom Haile: Yeah, I have the power.
Ali Serag: One is yesterday we announced the Shift the rewards platform, which is super exciting. If you guys haven't checked it out, go ahead and check it out right now. I believe the URL is rewards. flow. DOTS.COM And it's an exciting way to lock up flow and get a ton of returns. Whether it's in additional flow with insane, API, or NFTS or being able to get points that are usable in various platforms within the ecosystem. So it's
Ali Serag: It's an exciting way to engage and we're seeing a lot of activity. I think last time I checked it was over a million dollars. Let's see how much it is right now.
Tom Haile: Yeah, and you get an entity there, that represents your locked steak and that NFT can be traded on floating. This FY. 14.56% boost.
Ali Serag: In. Yeah.
Ali Serag: Beautiful, beautiful over 1.6 Million's already been locked. So getting on that, if you're interested, we're also less than Six days away from Crescendo on Mainnet. So if anyone that still has to upgrade any contracts, these last couple days are the last days to encourage them. If you know anyone that's struggling, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or anyone else on the team and we'll do our very best to help them, hit the mark on time.
Ali Serag: I want to put Dennis on the spot for a minute or two if possible because I noticed there was a new interesting capabilities Thing added to his staging website. Do you want to share a little bit about the events tracking and staging tracking Dennis?
Deniz Mert Edincik: Yeah, of course. in the statistics part, I added something. how much we migrated How much is stage already? Depending on the events or the resources on the chain? So now currently we are By events. Old staged. And with the resource base, we would like Ignoring the discontinued ones. So, I think we are in the really good stage.
Ali Serag: Perfect. And some of the top ones just looking at it keep items. You may even ft which is ticketmaster they should upgrade by the end of day tomorrow. So I agree with and it's I think by the end of this week at the very least by the end of this weekend, this should be mid 90s lower 90s. So,
Ali Serag: Yeah, congratulations on everyone.
Deniz Mert Edincik: It all remaining ones and…
Ali Serag: That's hustled for
Deniz Mert Edincik: there's nothing big there. it's all with simple projects and…
Ali Serag: it's Isn't.
Deniz Mert Edincik: somebody testing something the small ones especially, yeah.
Ali Serag: perfect. I'm very happy.
Ali Serag: We are on track friends. we've done the impossible.
BoHao Tang: Hey, I'm here. Yeah, yeah. And then show my screen and I just updates previous meeting I'm talking about I will upgrade token list to support. So Yeah, here is the result and there and overall it's due the totalist website. And no, quick readjust. what about token? I like Affordable.com. Not vulnerable need to implement, at least these two actor. I only recognize these to make the view in their contract views over. And if the non-able token correction, and they implement these two views, then it can be directly, Just to this list. And anyone can give me, I don't forgive me.
00:05:00
BoHao Tang: Address otherwise, maybe using Speaking page for the moment. let me check any red. And LFT this entity. And maybe not this one example, not this one.
BoHao Tang: However, this one, let me check. And for this novelty, I just input the dress and click Enter. Okay? There are several key there, maybe don't know that without any Yeah. Here it just played as no display. So that means this and I have tea even if your stages but there are the theft connection data and empty cartridge display if there are no ending notes without these Two. Main review cannot it can be registered but it will be at other editor later and let me then fight and door, Maybe there will be exception.
BoHao Tang: No, I can feel I fail to register. I think it will be error.
BoHao Tang: It will be a error to read it. Yeah. That means they are record some required without correction data. So cannot be registered to the tokenist And there are others, this UI later and it should be displayed as register. Should be like you without the application data, our optimize later. But yeah, once your token, I need to find that kind of things and try this one. I'm trying another dress.
BoHao Tang: Yeah, this one, it has a display. That means include the collection data and the Internet display that it will be successfully to register to the token list should Supposed to be. Yeah, It's already there. Just so That's the whole process for registering a non vulnerable token or really easy for everyone. And you can see here, Let me Push tab. This is the JSON list for the whole list. The currently only two, three NFT racing in this page and for
BoHao Tang: But Notice me, that means that URL is incorrect. If the spray like this one, my token and A party 20 token. It's has a cracks icon, correct banner, so it can be displayed here as an available gun. But if there are no display, that means that you are always incorrect. But yeah, actually you are found. Maybe this token is You cannot see Maybe they are a set to the wrong URL for the image. Maybe you are the owner you want to modify it and also This platform provide this kind of features like this is for affordable, organ. And this is for novel, okay?
BoHao Tang: You're here and you can modify I think this image is a giga, Whatever. But that means, if I call this URL is without checklist. The CIO is invalid. So we cannot like this trade anymore, but if you inputs very far, I'm sorry, a cracked. Like I read. And you are out here. You can see here check and the banner using reading English from the airport.
00:10:00
BoHao Tang: Website whatever but just like for that you get up updates the image by yourself and everyone can be distributor, This is the editor view for a reviewer and I can rank the LFT. This is like my talk, I can verify it also, I can set as a feature and you just transaction and that's on tag on this MRT.
BoHao Tang: and then you can see you can set every image for this kind of total. As you can check the tag here the features yes verify and you can update the icon banner for this entity all to other things and all these is a reviewer operation. And the No permission is anyone can be a reviewer then back to the list you will see here. This is a totalist and this is still there. image and no updates. But if you choose and reviewer like sorry,
BoHao Tang: we choose a river here. Yeah, there you will see. The image is updated. That means if you like query, this API with a parameter with a review address, then you will get the reverse that image, the name, displayed description. Everything is set by the reviewer in this editor, but if you didn't, I include a reviewer as you using a pure API, to where the information that will be the pure data, that's that in the contract.
BoHao Tang: And yes, really simple. I think the odd platform that include only The landing page for everything including Registration and Display, and how to use and that's it. And therefore, three page and this is for Editor for founderboard organ. You can add everything for volleyball, and this is for notes,
BoHao Tang: Besides this one and also This project is the open source in Github. Also, let me show This project it opensource here. And for here, the draft contract address and everything else. And also I create another project used I think forward to using this project, they focus one for the identic. File. What this report is used. They have a daily action for the github action. Yeah. And daily action. That is just think the
BoHao Tang: real time just a file. So here are the scripts when script is for things and actually, yes, the second for total list and just query the API provide by the Tokenist website and generate the JSON file. This is a test that this is men, that and this is the default before the Jesus file as a pure simple JSON file, they are. And also there are a lot of reviewer. you provide different just the file for other side and also I include several tag for the reviewer. this is featured for the reviewers. That means you acquired API with the review at this address and the future. So every token in business is featured by that address. So there is a tag
BoHao Tang: That featured and also you can click this tagged as verified by these reviewer. And you can have as a review that means this list is reviewed by this group and review and whatever default it is the reward list and the cast netlist will be, I think daily. So every 24 hours you will get to and updates just a list, Jason file for whenever I'm with key or for token. And the second is
BoHao Tang: I'm still working on the EVM side, the EVM list, EP 20 and the reality simultane wireless, and still working progress. But currently, I think for the presentation after the Christian upgrades, this website can be directly used for the
00:15:00
BoHao Tang: Product catalog to EDL, register any fundable token, and non vulnerable token and should be usable at the time and just upgrade for it. all the contracts already stated but not include, the left is I directly right ability in Cadence 1.0 So it's brand new and no need to stage. I wore up with the contract after presentation upgrade, and you're a great operating updated. And it not deployed on that directly deployed on test that with the one point old version. So there will be I can let the website upgrades on day one. So,
BoHao Tang: I think that's all here from very simple sample, how to use the API and This API is a real time. And caters file in real time. This real time is just a backhand with a little,
BoHao Tang: It's more interval backhand the catching in the radius but it's real time, but for that website but for some projects, what they want to using authentic JSON file as an incrementify low-watered, using this ripple for their total listing because they don't need using a real-time tokivist. It's just need to static chism file to query all existing vulnerable token or not. So they get directly using these website authorities report to correlate. The different following is repo and any other like whatever dax or any other new.
BoHao Tang: And new divide projects of local drug using that. Whatever token is then updates. But one thing is for now, the non-pounder portal can downfall is not like an energy catalog. They are only required to necessary metadata views that is and that the cat magnetic connection data and display and the other Made the view required other in origin of the catalog. I don't remember, maybe
BoHao Tang: I remember be five view is required in them and can I have to catalog but in enough to less problem the only two required because that's it only deteriorism necessary for Jason file. So I only like that is to that the required others, they're not required. So maybe it's a little bit different with other origin one. And I think that's all. And let me post the video.
BoHao Tang: Know it. sorry. Let me post, in the chat box. Yeah.
Ali Serag: Is this absolutely huge.
BoHao Tang: Yeah.
Ali Serag: Thank you so much for all your hard work Bohao. I'm really excited about this. How do we want to transition over everything that's currently on the NFT catalog to tokenless?
Ali Serag: What I noticed is when looking at the NFT catalog contract, there's an event that gets emitted whenever an entry is added where we could pull the contract payment address. I think it should be possible to just query, all of those names in contracts and I assume. Is there a batch at functionality with Tokenless bohao or do you have to add each individually?
BoHao Tang: No no. Just like rider script a new script including everything. Yeah maybe we need a creative groups to double check if the contracts is valid to add because You might transaction.
Ali Serag: Yeah, because it needs.
BoHao Tang: I only need to parameter that is the address and the contract net, and you can directly in register in the list. But if you like, your don't have without to necessary, Maryville, the graduate street, the rest of the redistration, transaction will be panic with error. first transaction. mit. You are see the error appearance. I mean, you without just necessary view. So we need additional work like we need to fuse or all Valid contract.
00:20:00
Ali Serag: Okay, So we need to have a check. And just, how many are there? Here's a hundred and ninety three items. We need to that's,
BoHao Tang: That's maybe we just not compare which one is stated. In the staging.
Ali Serag: Yeah no, I think that's awesome.
BoHao Tang: Contract.
Ali Serag: And then after we do that, is there anything else we would need to do for the migration? We just have to reach out to all the market places. and tools that rely on NFT catalog and maybe add a banner that pops up saying Go or migrating to Token list If your contracts here don't register an NFT here instead add it there and let them know that when this is going to be sunset or one, this is going to be deprecated and I'm thinking maybe have it like that for a month or two during that transition phase but we add all of these as many as possible there we reach out to all the marketplaces that are relying on NFT catalog and we let them know about the transition. Any other steps that anyone could think of that, we might need to do.
Ali Serag: No.
BoHao Tang: on another thing is, I think the premise of the Catholic provide a lot utility scripts to query the information.
BoHao Tang: And I'm not sure how many utility function other mug face it's using. but, country. I want to use the most used for things in the case of file, it's really easy to use. But actually I provide a script for carving the list and you can use recognition to quarry in the cadence, But I don't think that enough, utility function after promise to capital and my people is a really simple and I think, actually,
Ali Serag: And we can improve the UX…
BoHao Tang: Yeah.
Ali Serag: if possible.
Ali Serag: Dennis.
BoHao Tang: We can read this by ourselves because it's through a permissionless, you just No contract. We can directly readjust it. And actually, with any UI would you please?
BoHao Tang: Yeah. Yep.
BoHao Tang: Yeah. But when one more thing is, you just see the first one, I try address it is valid. We can find the dress who can find an empty in this address but without a lefty cat collection data maybe without a character view then the transaction failed. So we maybe do another future in transaction to ensure every address with whatever LFT is we feel it all the best with these two collection that we can automatically to read just all the Indians.
Ali Serag: The only other feedback is, I think we should have a little bit more. Information in the error that comes up. if they don't have everything, they need, when they try to register. So we could point them to what exactly they need to do. It's like, Hey, you need to add x y, and Z like this is the minimum requirements. Be able to register your token.
Ali Serag: All right, cool. Anyone else have any Concern, suggestions, Ideas relating to tokenist.
00:25:00
Ali Serag: Or NFT catalog.
Ali Serag: Okay, so next steps with it is go Haile mentioned that he's continuing to work on EVM integration. I will set up some user research interviews with marketplaces. And we should have a couple more updates on it. By the next working group, I'm going to hand it over to Jack to talk a little bit about flipside.
Jack Forgash: Thank I don't have anything to screen share necessarily. So I'll just chat. So yeah, over the past couple weeks, been working on deploying some new pipelines for the flow EVM execution environment.
Jack Forgash: And basically, just wanted to kind of run through that from a high level to make sure that we're kind of covering everything. we have a deep experience with EVM environments at flipside. So it rely on a lot of that and effectively like what we're going to ultimately end up having is a set of models that pull from the EDM execution environment, that sit alongside our current flow models looking at the test that data. It's very easy to pull out in a cadence transaction. When EBM transaction is executed, that gives me a hash and a block ID, but then that kind of, reveals the need we need a little bit more information to come in and view what's happening behind the scenes and put together a full, Analytics level view of what's actually happening within the EDM execution environment. So we're standing up a full set of models on that side and blocks with the transaction information.
Jack Forgash: In those, we'll get the receipts so we can get logs. And then presumably, we'll also grab traces as that's part of our standard M core set of models so that will end up with a core EVM. Schema that has, fact blocks transactions, logs, and traces and then come to the next step. From me is taking logs and turning them into Dakota logs because that's where we can get kind of the most useful information about what is happening within the execution of the transaction. So, for that, we have a, very robust set of functions and pipelines in order to decode logs but input, it's required in the form of Abis. So that's my question and maybe there's something out there. I frankly, haven't done enough research within what's available on the tooling side for Floyd the Amy yet. But I'm curious if anyone here has
Jack Forgash: a source of tool, kind of a roadmap for where flow. Contract APIs will end up being right now for Darian, for example, or BSC etherscan. and that set of block scanner tooling has a really robust API that is our primary source and then we also have a manual submission if anyone has one that was not available in there, someone comes in a flip side. Hey we want these logs in decoded event. Logs Here's the ABI for it, we verify it and then we pass it through our decoding process. So that's what I'm going to ultimately look to replicate. I think it always makes sense to have that manual submission for, contract tabs come in, but that first piece of
Jack Forgash: a robust in ecosystem tool, where I can pull down, any verified API that has already kind of lived somewhere else. That's what I think I need next. So that's kind of where I'm not stuck but just don't necessarily know where to find that or where to go.
Giovanni Sanchez: Cool.
Jack Forgash: And what that lets us do. Yes. take logs to code them and…
Giovanni Sanchez: Yeah, I would recommend talking to. I don't know…
Jack Forgash: present a much more useful,…
Giovanni Sanchez: if you've been in contact with your
Tom Haile: Martha. Yeah,…
Jack Forgash: frankly view of what's going on the logs,
Tom Haile: there you go.
Giovanni Sanchez: yeah, he's working on the Block Explorer. That will cover both, cadence, and evm events. So the person
Jack Forgash: okay, so I didn't quite catch with who
Giovanni Sanchez: I'll type his name here. He's like
00:30:00
Jack Forgash: Okay, thank you.
Tom Haile: Yeah, flow What is it Flow, scan Dot IO. Is that…
Giovanni Sanchez: Yeah.
Tom Haile: what it's gonna be? They're going through, I'll rebranding and all that. So that'll be the place where developers can verify their EDM contracts.
Jack Forgash: Yeah, I've been using that from just a Check,…
Tom Haile: Yeah.
Jack Forgash: checking blocks and transactions against what I'm pulling down.
Jack Forgash: That I haven't looked in the smart contract methods on the API there.
Jack Forgash: So I can take a look there.
Tom Haile: I think. Yeah. Also you bring up a good question, all the flow Foundation, EVM contracts need to be verified. So Geo. who's the contact With that.
Giovanni Sanchez: I don't know if there is a contact but I don't know a day or two ago. If there been any progress in Acts, I need to verify some of the contract, the bridge. Those that are deployed to EVM. So I just haven't had time to really dive into that. But bearte, it looks like he's kind of gone down this path. Of working to verify contracts. But that's not that he's like documentation and all that.
Ali Serag: yeah, and I mean there's documentation right now on how to verify, Your contracts, put it in the heart hat. There's Inside the heart attacks, guys. If you go to EVM. So this is just FYI, in case anyone asks how in the world do I verify my contract? I added this section here and I also chatted collaborated with brake as this is essentially what he's using as well to verify the contracts. There's a ton of documentation on Block Scouts developer docs as well that walk you through it that I link to
Ali Serag: This is the Block Explorer that is like going to be used for flow EVM. Jack, there's a section for verified contracts if you click on it, I'm not entirely sure. I haven't played around with it too much but there might be a way to pull out the AVI here. But yeah, I would just check this.
Jack Forgash: Okay, perfect. I think I looked last week, there weren't too many verified contracts in that page yet.
Ali Serag: Okay. I'm also Jack.
Jack Forgash: Four bite, direct. yeah. That's
Ali Serag: Speaking of docs, if there's any challenges that you come into or things that you think are broken, please don't hesitate to just message and reach out because we're like kaizen continuous improvement of the docs.
Jack Forgash: Okay, for sure.
Jack Forgash: yeah. I can start with those and take a look like I said and the major structures will be there in place, Wednesday of next week when it goes live. try to have as many decoded logs as possible, but that's the pipeline that will be dependent on how good of an API source I can get But yeah, everything else will be there. And the tooling has been very robust to the public access notes have been great. I think we will end up using quick notes just because we already have an enterprise agreement with them and they are going to and, if we don't have to hammer the public notes and but everything's been great so far.
Tom Haile: That's awesome. Jack, I asked in the EVM channel about flow foundation, medium contracts, being verified. So if you want to Jump in on that created jump on the thread and…
Jack Forgash: okay, pretty sure on the flow one,…
Tom Haile: say I'm very interested in this information.
Jack Forgash: I don't Spend too much time to discord anymore.
Tom Haile: It's just Right.
Tom Haile: Yeah, we'll see. we can keep you up to date on what's going on there.
Jack Forgash: I see a message.
Ali Serag: Yeah, I was just sharing. There's the data indexers page which if you guys are also going to be on the EVM side, it might make a lot of sense to just add you guys to the list. There.
Ali Serag: Hey exactly. And it could just be copy pasta. remember that developer? Sorry the docs that we were talking about before for accessing data on the cadence side and your team together. we could just copy pasta then and just add it a little bit more to be more centric.
00:35:00
Ali Serag: Perfect.
Ali Serag: And just add me as a reviewer. Alright.
Tom Haile: It's good stuff.
Ali Serag: Alright, we have some new faces that ended up joining That was pretty much it on the agenda for today. Tom was there anything else or
Tom Haile: I have EDM tools on there. We can continue on that…
Ali Serag: Okay.
Tom Haile: if anyone has anything specific about EDM tools or anything missing or any kind of support needed. For building taps on the EDM side. or if anyone's even started on Testnet,
Tom Haile: Yep.
BoHao Tang: A sort of face another maybe really to toeing issue. is I find about under blows your eye when I need to Add the dependency of Evia Bridge. And that is because, several contracts in that dress, not stated in the testnet. And
BoHao Tang: then if you import any verified staged contracts, don't be a error. For the command you cannot add dependency for their kind of contract. If there is any other stages. Contract under these address. So I rise a bug, I read the issue on PROCL AI so that I find when I want to important contrast Doesn't mention.
Tom Haile: 
Tom Haile: 
BoHao Tang: Yeah, yeah,…
Tom Haile: Yeah, thanks.
BoHao Tang: just accredited.
Tom Haile: And you created a get of it issues.
BoHao Tang: So maybe it's
Tom Haile: What you said? Okay. Yeah. Okay we can allocate resources. We've been kind of booked here for the past couple of weeks. That'll be a good one. Greg will take lead on that,…
BoHao Tang: Yeah, posting the chatterbox.
Tom Haile: he's the man. Right. Cool.
Tom Haile: yeah, so one thing that we're working on is even a bridge and I'm just from a UI perspective, the low port so fullport, I'll have the functionality or users to bridge back and forth between Bridge assets back and forth on VMs and we'll be using a token list for the side and Ali remind me who we're going to end up using Or is that going to be like a?
Ali Serag: Could you ask the question again?
Tom Haile: It's gonna evolve over time for EVM tokens.
Ali Serag: Throws messaging.
Tom Haile: So, the flow board needs to know about EVM tokens,…
Ali Serag: Yes.
Tom Haile: plungible tokens and non-punchable tokens. And Who's gonna manage That took discovery?
Ali Serag: For low port for the token.
Tom Haile: I think, I know…
Ali Serag: This couldn't we just use tokenist.
Tom Haile: but I just wanted to ask
Ali Serag: I might be understanding. yeah.
Greg Santos: Yeah, I was gonna say probably just happen to token list for that, right?
Tom Haile: yeah, that's
Greg Santos: So, maybe you can like,…
Tom Haile: Yeah, that's…
Greg Santos: talk closer with Bohao about the integration and…
Tom Haile: what I was thinking. I wanted to ask the question. cool,…
Greg Santos: as we release.
Tom Haile: cool. Because
Tom Haile: They?
BoHao Tang: We can deal, we can directly using the total institution file report.
Tom Haile: Yeah, that'd be great. we'll be chatting.
BoHao Tang: So it's a simple to use only. Request that Jason file and you can get listed you need to work standard. So I think a lot of taxes using the standard.
Tom Haile: yeah, currently we're using a flu scan
Tom Haile: but we can use whatever, you know what I mean.
BoHao Tang: You mean EBM token and for now it's not supported in the tokenist, It's only okay, there's only but in future maybe we can use it. But yeah, total is for kids tender token tokens, currently include everything…
00:40:00
Tom Haile: Okay, yeah,…
BoHao Tang: but even side maybe for now to close it better.
Tom Haile: yeah, okay, that makes sense. Yeah, we're using storage for the cane side for the user. so we might use Token List as we move forward,…
BoHao Tang: I see that difference usage,…
Tom Haile: we're just building all out.
BoHao Tang: token there's no address then they're just like that maybe just a need for query and on the whole program. So, it's no address provided just get a list. So in this scenario, we're using tokens, but if there is a dress loading and in this kind of that we can directly occur with the story API together, whatever you need account storage, and I think that's different scenario.
Tom Haile: Yeah, I totally different use case. It would be convenient. I'm just saying, but I'm not sure you want to At that kind of overhead but okay, cool totally. It's my course. I appreciate It's the other on the agenda missing tooling any improvements.
Tom Haile: if any kind of open discussion, Anything missing. Anyone seeing as they're developing stuff?
Tom Haile: I do want to point out thanks, Dennis for the heads up on the cadence, 1o pipe Dot what was that again? I just copy and pasted it, It was solved my problem.
Deniz Mert Edincik: What was that? yeah,…
Tom Haile: Is recovered.
Deniz Mert Edincik: is ver Yeah, it's this new feature for the recovered. Resources.
Tom Haile: Yeah.
Deniz Mert Edincik: I think it's on Testnet, yet. But I think it will be also in Mainnet in the same. And it will support I guess not one. It is supporting. I guess. Maybe Ft. But then,
Deniz Mert Edincik: Yeah, it will support old FTE Nfd collections. So it will be pretty good. if you have some old contract people. You forgot to upgrade, you can deploy new one and exchange, the old nfts with the new one or something like that.
Deniz Mert Edincik: Rather welcome.
Tom Haile: Yeah, I had up on this because of old usdc collections, that won't be upgraded. And so, my geos account,…
Deniz Mert Edincik: Yeah, it went better than I expected to be honest.
Tom Haile: iterator script blew up And so, this saved,…
Deniz Mert Edincik: I would read that we would not catch port of September…
Tom Haile: bacon or saved low port, bacon on that so much. Appreciate
Deniz Mert Edincik: but it seems like everything going super Really good job.
Tom Haile: I'll say it takes a village to upgrade a blockchain.
Tom Haile: Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. Yeah. Yeah. Team is put a lot of work into it and it's coming together. So all the work is showing fruit.
Tom Haile: Totally agree. it's kind of, like, One. We don't want to count our chickens before. They're But two, we can celebrate the test net. It was very successful.
Tom Haile: Yeah, I think that that's all. I got Ali.
Ali Serag: Right. Perfect.
Tom Haile: Also my agenda.
Ali Serag: We have 10 minutes left. I guess. We'll open it up.
Tom Haile: I do also.
Ali Serag: 
Tom Haile: I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're opening up. I do want to read mention rewards that you mentioned earlier. So yeah, I'll go check it out. Lock up some Get some extra flow.
Tom Haile: Chances are, you could lock up. List your NFT, make a little bump and then relock up and…
00:45:00
Deniz Mert Edincik: Also metadata image on this MFT is like,…
Tom Haile: actually do pretty good.
Deniz Mert Edincik: amazing with this animation. Everything. I don't know who did it. But it looks really cool.
Tom Haile: It's totally agree. Yeah they use the SVG Greg.
Deniz Mert Edincik: Yeah.
Tom Haile: You want to tell us a little bit about that.
Greg Santos: Yeah, no doubt all on chain SVG dynamic data coming from the contract. So you can always see that scrolling on your NFT. So you have locked? You see how many rewards total you're gonna get and see how many are currently available as they go up over the time period. and then, once we cross over into the Redemption period after 32 days, you'll start to be able to claim those rewards on a linear basis. Pull out the flow, right to your wallet and that flow will be redeemable on the EVM side. So let's say you have 10 rewards come redemption, once it's available to you, you'll claim it.
Greg Santos: not to get what we can be. Technical is the flow tools group, that'll go to yours, CoA, which is your EVM side address, and then you'll have flow on EVM. You'll be able to use that, you'll come withdraw that, of course, or use that in some of the partner programs we have coming up. We've got Raffles planned, a little bit of sort of a point store where you might be able to purchase some things with it. And then you'll just immediately flow on ready to go.
Tom Haile: That's awesome. There's a too early to talk about points.
Greg Santos: yeah, If we'll do a little taste, but if you have a flow wallet already, then you should have a COA and you'll be able to grab that address from the wallet. And make sure that your point your rewards go to that address, otherwise, as Tom said, you'll be able to create a CLA right from LO Port. On the point side of things that's also coming down the pipe. and points will be like an off-chain mechanism, similar to a lot of other chain point systems, you'll earn points for this initial lockup period and having an LG NFT, you'll be able to earn points after the program starts with some of these other partners and two, other means that you'll see coming and then those points Will be used in. As I said, the point store or raffles, a lot of things we have planned for it.
Greg Santos: So, stay tuned on that. Thanks.
Tom Haile: Bill in the Alpha Where to Go G.
Tom Haile: Open for discussion, any questions?
Tom Haile: I think that's it. If anyone doesn't have any questions or anything come up, Greg was spilling the alpha.
Tom Haile: But we can call it. I appreciate your time. Thanks, great discussions.
Ali Serag: Thank you, everyone.
Tom Haile: Looking forward to listen and built out and flip side. Being built out, good stuff, make a progress.
Greg Santos: Yeah, yeah. Thanks everybody.
Ali Serag: I'm just before we and very last thing. If you have any ideas for future conversations in the tooling working group, don't forget that we have the Google sheets where you could add them to actually pull that up. Working Group Wish List.
Ali Serag: And again this working group is extremely collaborative. So the topics are sourced from the community as well as the team internally. If you're working on a project that you think is useful, or if you notice that there's any tooling gaps for developers on the EDM side, or cadence side, or bugs in existing tooling enhancements, that could be made. We definitely want to hear about it. don't be shy of, just like adding it to the sheet and we'll prioritize and add it to the conversations going forward. So please do contribute and looking forward to the next chat. Thank you.
