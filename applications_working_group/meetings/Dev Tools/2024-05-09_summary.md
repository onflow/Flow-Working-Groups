Summary:

The meeting began with Tom Haile leading a discussion on technical updates and agenda items, covering the current status of the bridge and data availability, as well as the focus on OKRs and the delay in the testnet migration timeline. Giovanni Sanchez added insights on the on-chain randomness for EVM and the status of the bridge's PR for deployment to PreviewNet. Additionally, Tom Haile mentioned the ongoing work on Flowport, including the creation of COA addresses and the transfer of assets across the bridge, with an emphasis on providing a demo for testing soon. Chase provided a status update on the contract manager, contributing to the overall technical progress and developments within the team.

The team then discussed the challenges and opportunities related to data availability and query ability for end user applications, particularly focusing on the limitations and capabilities of access nodes. The conversation revolved around the rollout of local script execution onto public nodes and the challenges related to memory and compute contention issues. Peter Argue provided insights into the availability of resources and rate limits for users on public nodes, as well as the enterprise plan offered by QuickNode for larger dApps. The team also discussed the EVM access plan, emphasizing the need for load testing and sizing before transitioning to QuickNode to ensure smooth operation.

The team also discussed various issues with the Cadence testing framework, including the need to specify paths for contracts, the lack of control over deployment sequence, and challenges in testing certain functionalities. They emphasized the importance of improving documentation, adding more control over deployment, and enhancing the standard library to make the framework more accessible and functional for users. Additionally, they suggested leveraging existing patterns from EVM and Solidity contract development to enhance the usability of the Cadence testing framework.

Finally, the team engaged in a detailed discussion about the integration of core contracts for application developers and the need for standard operations such as adding, revoking, and changing keys. They also considered the possibility of including common operations in the CLI to simplify tasks for partners, and explored the idea of creating custom commands and aliases in the CLI for familiar scripts and transactions. Additionally, they touched upon the potential challenges and benefits of moving Flix on-chain and the need for a well-organized web interface for account management tasks. The meeting concluded with Tom expressing gratitude and setting the next meeting date.

Dev Tools Working Group 
Thu. May 9, 2024

0:52 - Unidentified Speaker 
you Right.

1:00 - Tom Haile 
Oh, you got your laptop fixed.

1:07 - Akos Erdos 
Yeah. Yeah. Partially heating up a lot. I need to find a solution for a little bit, but at least I can access my data now. Oh, nice.

1:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
And turn it on.

1:22 - Tom Haile 
Is that Intel, Intel inside?

1:25 - Akos Erdos 
Yes.

1:25 - Tom Haile 
Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. The, the Intel max I've had that always heat up and get ridiculous.

1:34 - Tom Haile 
But the, I haven't had that problem with the, the M one and two laptops I have.

1:40 - Akos Erdos 
Those are newer isn't it?

1:47 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, yeah, no wonder apple is winning kind of Well, yeah.

1:52 - Akos Erdos 
Yeah.

1:52 - Tom Haile 
No wonder they changed the processor Yeah, true true Hey goodness Yeah, I um He was a senior engineer at Apple, and he was in the hardware area or whatever. And he said just one day, they just kicked out all the Intel guys. They had Intel guys on site working. And then Apple said, oh, we're done with Intel. And no one knew in his department. And it was like, oh, well, guys, it was nice working with you.

2:33 - Tom Haile 
And then they kicked them all out. It was kind of funny. Hey, guys.

2:40 - Greg Santos 
Thanks for coming.

2:42 - Tom Haile 
Thanks, Peter, and Tom, Hal, Angie, everyone. What do we got here? So a couple of agenda items Ollie put together. Ollie's not going to be able to make it. It's kind of the two big things that are on the agenda is the bridge, right? So thanks, Gio, showing up. We can talk about that, kind of get a current status of that. I've started, me and Alex have started using some of the The transactions and stuff that you just put together for the bridge and blah, blah, blah.

3:20 - Tom Haile 
So we should have a pretty good little demo here in about a week or so. And then number two is data availability. You know, thanks Peter showing up for, for Rashal. And we can kind of talk about data availability from, from like building applications perspective, from service backend stuff, all that kind of thing. I was hoping, um, Bart would be here, but he's, today's his day off. He's like in a cabin somewhere.

3:45 - Tom Haile 
And uh, so we'll kind of continue continue on with that And then the kind of the last part would be just kind of current state of tools In the community and all that kind of stuff and any tools that y'all are working on in the community How can we help and that kind of thing from the flow foundation? Uh building out tools as well and all that kind of stuff. I was just wondering if uh cross vm bridge Oh, let me go over OKRs real quick.

4:16 - Tom Haile 
So nothing strange that I know about OKRs. Add to this is that we have a crescendo upgrade made up of two parts. One King's Borough upgrade, and then two EVM, so flow EVM. And so all of our efforts have been concentrated on that in terms of building out tools and documentation in that arena. Anything else that's popped up recently, Greg?

4:42 - Greg Santos 
No, we're good? Okay, cool, cool, cool. Oh, that's definitely the yeah, that's the focus remains to be Looks like a little bit of a delay to the timeline for the testnet migration Got bumped about a month.

4:54 - Tom Haile 
But otherwise, we're still on track for that most other things and Yeah, continuing with those efforts And when you say about bump a month Is it are we talking into this month or you're talking about I got bumped again.

5:11 - Greg Santos 
I No, the original target was May 22nd, and it looks like it'll be pushed a bit from that. So I believe mid-June. It might only be three weeks.

5:27 - Tom Haile 
Okay. Geo, you got something?

5:32 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah, one more thing that is on my radar is On-chain randomness for EVM. I mean, I guess I would can constitute as like a dev tool Definitely mostly like Like a contract and that's I guess a set of like interfaces and and contracts on the EVM side that Might be made to be

5:55 - Tom Haile 
a little bit more developer friendly so they get it, right? Yeah, is that concentrating those utilities into that 1 utility contract that 1 thing we talked about?

6:05 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Are you talking about a more of a change reorganization? Yeah, well, I guess that's that's another kind of angle for just like, the more general. Interactions from K to EVM. So I guess to clarify, to give a little bit more context there, throughout the process of like having to orchestrate these EVM operations from cadence, there are a couple of contracts, really like one or two contracts that are part of the bridge repo that might be useful, like utility contracts.

6:38 - Giovanni Sanchez 
There are a couple others that I have in mind as well, but that might be useful for exposing a subset of interactions on a COA, but I guess that's a little bit more abstract. I haven't really thought that through, but just imagine a library of cadence functionality that you can call from cadence that would allow you to The other thing that I was referring to is more so like solidity contracts that would allow you to really easily get either revertible and or non-revertible randomness and like implementing that into your contract.

7:25 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Okay, we can talk about randomness probably towards the end. I'm super curious about that. So I think that'll work.

7:43 - Tom Haile 
Chases here another agenda item we have is the contract manager. So it would be great to get a status on that. Thank you chase and then Let's continue Specifically on what you were talking about about the the bridge.

7:56 - Giovanni Sanchez 
What's the current state of the bridge? Yeah, so there's a there's one more PR out and And that's mostly Solidity-focused. So basically the worst case with the existing codebase as it is on main is the bridge cadence contracts, which we have this pretty flexible, well-known pattern of upgrading contract functionality and cadence. In EBM, it seems, at least for me, I'm not super experienced with Solidity, but from what I can tell, it seems to be quite a bit more rigid.

8:31 - Giovanni Sanchez 
To introduce it to allow for the example for example to like add new ERC's on the EVM side in the future The solidity contracts had to be refactored a bit So that PR is currently out And I don't think he's here Jordan Sean took a look at that. He's pretty familiar with solidity Seems to think that it's alright, but I do need approval from approval from a code owner.

8:54 - Tom Haile 
So That's for the flow EVM bridge.

9:02 - Giovanni Sanchez 
I can paste the link here. But that's ready to get deployed to PreviewNet, assuming EVM. I think I did see EVM functionality is back online on PreviewNet. So once I get that merged, I'll be able to redeploy on PreviewNet, and we should be good to go there. Thank you, Bill.

9:22 - Tom Haile 
Nice, nice, nice, nice. All right.

9:29 - Tom Haile 
Any questions on the bridge currently? There's a repo, PR's coming in.

9:36 - Tom Haile 
Alex and I are working on Flowport. Flowport now, we have a kind of a working branch where you can create your COA, you can get your COA address, so all that's there. And then we'll be adding basically a display of your balances, so you'll know your flow balance on the cadence side and you'll know your flow balance on the EVM side. But we'll have, we'll have that out a couple of days and stuff. And then Alex is working on transferring assets, you know, across the bridge and all that kind of thing.

10:05 - Tom Haile 
So we'll, we'll have something that people can play with. So very soon. So that'd be cool. Okay. Thanks. You want to give us a status of the contract manager? It's definitely a tool people, people will want to use.

10:21 - Chase Fleming 
Sure, yeah. So I don't know if there's been too many changes to it. And it's been a couple of bug fixes in the last sprint. And it's been mostly focused on tying it into this new interactive initialization for project setup. And that becomes really useful there in terms of just building up a whole directory or project structure for you with everything you need. But there have been a couple issues submitted that I'm going to address next from some people in the community that have been using it.

10:57 - Chase Fleming 
So it's awesome to see that come in unprompted. So if you are using it and you see anything, please let us know. But yeah, it seems like usage is going up. We've also updated the Hello World CLI example to give you a little taste of how to use it, And yeah, I highly encourage you to use it. If you haven't yet, it's a way. Quick summary on Dependency Manager is a lot of times you're going to work on another project.

11:26 - Chase Fleming 
Let's say you need to get the non, well, not use core contract to sample. Let's say a float, right? You have to go copy paste float into your project. And you need to go find all of the contracts that float imports, copy and paste those into your project. Then you've got to change all the import syntax. It works with CLI, so it works off your flow JSON configuration. So that handles all that for you with a simple command.

11:51 - Chase Fleming 
So you could say install float, and it installs everything in your flow CLI, installs all the dependencies, puts them into a folder for you. You could even rerun it again to update them if they get out of date.

12:03 - Tom Haile 
So I highly encourage anybody to try that. Nice. Nice. That's convenient. Cool. Anything else you want to add or any questions? Any questions for Chase or anything about contract manager?

12:22 - Tom Haile 
Cool, cool, cool. That's good.

12:26 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah, what you got? Yeah, one quick question on the interactive in it. So well, it sounds like I'll be able to set up a new project and all of the aliases for the standard of the core contracts. Will I be able to just rely on those being in my flow config?

12:49 - Chase Fleming 
Yeah, great question. Um, and yeah, actually maybe give context on the interactive project setup. Cause it's not released yet, but we've been working on it. Give a little demo yesterday. Um, but that setup for that is now when you'd run a knit, it would prompt you. You want to install core contracts. You could select from them, install them, install some dependencies. It sets up all your folders for you.

13:11 - Chase Fleming 
It adds in like, um, some boilerplate. Contracts, script, transactions, tests. So literally all you have to do is run a net. And then flow dev or flow test. But in that case, with the aliases, it actually works right now. You don't even have to use interactive init, right? So if you do install a core contract, because it's a core contract, we are already aware of all of the aliases that are available across different networks from one of the packages that we have.

13:37 - Chase Fleming 
So all of those are installed by default. So yeah, you wouldn't have to do any of that.

13:44 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Cool. That's awesome.

13:45 - Chase Fleming 
That'll save a lot of time on setup.

13:48 - Chase Fleming 
Cool. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. And let me know if you find anything, but yeah, that works as is on the current release.

13:56 - Tom Haile 
Nice. Nice. We'll see.

14:00 - Tom Haile 
I think I'll just get to the big discussion kind of thing of the meeting is data availability, query ability, all that kind of stuff. And is there, based on our last meeting of data availability. So it's a big deal, right? So the interesting thing about building applications, so in end user applications, How do they get the data they need in order to present a good rich UX for their user? And correct me if I'm wrong, right?

14:38 - Tom Haile 
Only like blocks, maybe a thousand blocks of data are available via the access nodes. Is that still the case?

14:51 - Peter Argue 
with caveats. So the access node will have data going back to the beginning of the spork in terms of blocks and transactions.

15:02 - Peter Argue 
But in terms of script execution, so you want to run a script to query a specific state, execution nodes have 100 blocks-ish of state. And so if the access node is configured to talk to an execution node, then that's all you can look at is the last 100 blocks. We've recently rolled out local script execution. So access nodes can Store all of the state changes throughout the whole spork Into a local database and now you can query that access node for any block that it has indexed so On nodes with local script execution enabled.

15:43 - Peter Argue 
That's no longer the case It's not fully rolled out at this point, but it's on on a few nodes And if you wanted to start your own node, you could launch your own node with it enabled.

15:55 - Tom Haile 
And so that's like the, are we still calling it observer nodes? Launch your own node?

16:00 - Peter Argue 
You can run a staked access node. So we support permissionless staked access nodes. And then this is enabled on observers, but only in a trusted setup. So an access node needs to trust that the observer node is not going to attack them.

16:24 - Peter Argue 
So you could run it on an observer, but you would need to have an upstream access node that was willing to trust you.

16:34 - Tom Haile 
And what's the trust aspect if the observer just wants to run scripts?

16:43 - Peter Argue 
The complication is the way we transfer that data, it uses a protocol called BitSwap. And BitSwap is, it's used by IPFS and Filecoin on like their networks, but it's not really tuned in the way we're using it to be supported on our public network because if someone was malicious, they could easily overwhelm the nodes that were on the network. And so there's work it out in a way where access nodes don't need to trust the observers not to attack them, but currently that's not implemented.

17:28 - Peter Argue 
It's technically supported, it's actually enabled on one of our access nodes, but it's not something we would promote externally yet.

17:41 - Tom Haile 
Okay. Okay. I think I, I think I get it. I know, uh, uh, Deniz, you have a, I think an access node that doesn't throw any data away that like just stores it into a database and makes it available.

17:56 - Deniz Mert Edincik 
Uh, yeah, I have something like, uh, I am following the blocks with, uh, streaming endpoint and indexing them. And, uh, then you can run all the scripts from the time you started indexing, actually. So I started from the like spark. Uh, so it kind of works.

18:19 - Tom Haile 
And you said, what was, uh, what was the current footprint? Well, like 40 gigs or something like that.

18:25 - Deniz Mert Edincik 
Yeah, it is not that big. It's like, uh, especially state is small. I think like, I am also like trying to replicate access not. So I have also protocol state. It is like little bit bigger. Ledger state is like pretty small to run execution, uh, run scripts on any block height from last work is like, let me see what this decides.

18:58 - Tom Haile 
It's interesting.

18:59 - Deniz Mert Edincik 
So is that a, uh, like a staked node, like hundreds gigs or something like this now? Okay. No, it's not steak. It's just, uh, from the access, not streaming end points. It's just following the chain, all the state changes.

19:15 - Tom Haile 
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. All right. I think I got it. I think I understand where you're coming from That makes sense. And so, uh, I guess from, uh, the kind of the next step separation of the day and all that kind of stuff is how would applications get access to data if they don't want to run a note? That's kind of the question. And, um, I, and not get, uh, basically rate limited. That's kind of the question.

19:45 - Tom Haile 
So it's like, is there a paid service? And I was hoping that it'd be hard to be here, but it's not here, but the, yeah. So it's kind of like if someone has an application, they're willing to pass costs down to their user. If they have a value use case, how would they be able to scale up and use existing infrastructure? Or does that infrastructure not exist? That's the kind of question for data availability.

20:10 - Peter Argue 
So we are in the process of rolling this out. There are some performance things that we need to sort out before rolling it out onto the public nodes. It is partially rolled out onto the public nodes, and we had it rolled out for a while. But we're sorting through some kind of memory and compute contention issues from the multi-tenant, many scripts running at the same time. But in the near future, we'll be rolling it out onto the public node.

20:43 - Peter Argue 
So using the public access nodes would be using this directly.

20:48 - Tom Haile 
Do you have a name for this, which you're talking about?

20:55 - Peter Argue 
Local script execution is the term we've been using. You could. OK, gotcha. Yeah. Basically, access node the way that everyone thinks it should work. Yeah.

21:09 - Jerome Pimmel 
But isn't that just another node that someone has to run? I think Tom was asking, what if they don't want to run a node?

21:14 - Peter Argue 
What I'm saying is we'll be rolling it out onto the public nodes, so the nodes that everyone uses today. And then we'll be working with Quicknode to come up with ways to offer this in their offerings. And then in terms of other infrastructure providers, yeah, that's TBD.

21:40 - Tom Haile 
You bring up a good point. So for, for quick note, so if I pay whatever, 10 bucks, 30 bucks a month, that kind of thing. Um, how do I know what is available as in like, does quick node have the same restrictions as a access node today? Like really I can only go execute a hundred blocks or, you know, that kind of thing. It's not like they're building out something special.

22:08 - Peter Argue 
the standard configuration. So they're using execution nodes. As we roll this out, they will be switching to using local execution. And then that would give access to the full range of blocks. So we're working with them on that. There's just some As we transition from running scripts on nodes with over a terabyte of memory to nodes with a reasonable amount of memory, there's been some growing pains.

22:37 - Peter Argue 
So we're working through those. But the goal is to have it publicly available on the public nodes.

22:44 - Tom Haile 
OK.

22:45 - Jerome Pimmel 
That makes sense. That makes sense. Can I clarify one thing on that, Peter? Yeah. The public nodes will, even so, even though there's running script execution, there will still be rate limits, right? It's always going to be the case on public nodes. And to address the point that Tom was making about, you know, for people who want to scale up their app and they don't want to have rate limits, I think, is it not the case that QuickNode, you can approach QuickNode and they can run a hosted node for you where you can have the rate limits removed for your app and you can just do whatever you need at whatever rates you need?

23:18 - Peter Argue 
Is that something they offer? Yeah. Yeah. And they do have the enterprise plan, which is for larger types of dApps that want like single tenancy. They want their own node, like that's an option. Um, so there, there are a few options in terms of what you can do with, with quick node in the config.

23:40 - Deniz Mert Edincik 
Yes. Which got, uh, I think the problem here is, uh, kind of not technical, but like more like business problem. Because like this, uh, like, I don't know, like, for example, as a user, it's like, there's no chance that like somebody will pay some money to quit. Not when there's like a public note with this, like rate limits with high rate limits. Like, for example, like it's like, it is like rate limiting is not like IP based and like, it's like, getting another one IP for my server is like $1 per month or maybe less.

24:22 - Deniz Mert Edincik 
So it is like scaling using public node and abusing public node is like more business sense. So it is like, I don't know, like it's if QuickNode has any customers and the price level, but it's in technical level, it's not making much sense.

24:44 - Peter Argue 
Some of that is us unraveling. Historically, we've over-delivered on what's available on the public nodes by having massive limits on what you can do with script execution and having very high limits on many of the endpoints for the public nodes. And we're starting to unwind that a bit and put more restrictions in place. With script execution, we're definitely going to have to do that in terms of limiting the complexity of scripts just in terms of how do you run hundreds of scripts per second without tipping nodes over.

25:23 - Peter Argue 
So we need to put some restrictions on that. And so I think where this is going to end up getting to is you can use the public nodes with restrictions and limits on how many queries you can make and how many resources you can use in those queries. And then if you want to run your own node, you can remove all of those.

25:46 - Peter Argue 
to pay for improved service, you want higher limits or more complex script execution and things like that, then you could get the paid offering. But I agree, as it is today, the value proposition isn't super good.

26:07 - Tom Haile 
A question about what's the state of having parity between execution and transaction? I'm sure you guys are execution.

26:20 - Peter Argue 
Is there a change coming? There is a change coming. We're discussing how exactly to communicate that out. But right now, scripts support 10 times more compute units than transactions. Transactions are at 10k, scripts are at 100k.

26:43 - Peter Argue 
The compute units is a rough approximation of how much memory can be used, how many registers can be looked up and things like that. And so with the current limits, it's not really viable to run scripts at scale on the public nodes. So we'll be reducing that down. I think the initial thinking is probably in parity with transactions, so it 10,000, may come down lower before we make any changes. We're going to do like data validation on scripts that are overseeing today and where those are at.

27:15 - Peter Argue 
So we're just getting into looking at that.

27:18 - Tom Haile 
So more information to come. Okay. Okay. Is there, is there any way of estimating? So if I write a big script, I want to estimate if I'm going to meet some limit or whatever. Is there any way of doing that? I don't like estimate gas.

27:35 - Peter Argue 
I think in the emulator, it will tell you, um, like you can get that information. Um, if not, then we'll, we'll make sure that that is a thing that you can do. Um, yeah. Yeah. I'm not a hundred percent sure.

27:52 - Tom Haile 
All right, who's that?

27:53 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Gio, what you got? If I run my own node, can I increase that limit?

27:59 - Peter Argue 
Yeah, it's configurable by the node. So you could set it to whatever you wanted. It's just you need to have a large server. So if you have a large enough server, you could set that as high as you want it.

28:12 - Tom Haile 
I see. Cool.

28:19 - Tom Haile 
intersection point of how big your script is to how long it runs opposed to just breaking your script up and ran too small or whatever, but okay. Okay. That makes sense. I don't know. What about, what about EVM access are through public nodes and also will quick note also have an EVM.

28:42 - Jerome Pimmel 
That's going to be the plan.

28:46 - Jerome Pimmel 
Right now, because it's still a little bit under development, and we haven't finished things like benchmarking it, load testing it, and kind of sizing, you know, we need to do sizing, what kind of a node it's going to really need, and, you know, really kind of put it through its paces, which we haven't yet done. And then we'll put it through its paces, we're going to run it for a little while so that we can understand what's working, what's not, and everything, you know, metrics and logs is everything where we need it to be, because we need it to be in a very sweet spot before we hand it over to QuickNode so that we don't have to constantly collaborate with them to troubleshoot things.

29:21 - Jerome Pimmel 
If we do that in the early stages of the release, then that's likely to be quite painful. So we're thinking it'll probably be a couple of months while we'll still be running the EVM gateway initially. But it is going to get transitioned over to be able to run on QuickNode. And they'll obviously configure that gateway to call any of the public access nodes behind it. But that's going to be the plan.

29:44 - Tom Haile 
Yeah. I see. So public access nodes will handle both Cadence and EVM?

29:50 - Jerome Pimmel 
Is that the plan or to split those out? Well, the access that doesn't handle EVM to be completely clear, right? You have to run another node called the EVM gateway, which delegates to an access node. So without the two, you can't use EVM without both the EVM gateway and the access node. Right now, Query Node only runs Access Nodes. And today, we're the ones running the Gateway Node. What will happen in the future is they will run both node types, as anyone can.

30:16 - Jerome Pimmel 
Anyone could run both node types as well, any individual or group. And so that's going to be the configuration going forward. And so the Access Node supports anything that calls it. And because the Gateway is calling it with scripts and responding to Web3 clients that way, Access Nodes de facto support Yeah, they don't serve the API, that's all.

30:43 - Peter Argue 
I think the question that you're asking, Tom, is that the URLs that we'll be publishing for developers will be public, and they'll be routed wherever we send it. So it'll be on our infrastructure, but we're going to have public, free URLs.

31:05 - Tom Haile 
published, excuse me, public URLs for providers for the EVM stuff, just in the EVM ecosystem, that kind of thing. So that, that makes sense. Is there any, talking about data availability, I think we've covered the server side and all that. Is there any added server infrastructure being talked about? Talked about that would sit on top of our server availability, stuff like the graph or anything of that nature?

31:40 - Peter Argue 
It's probably a Jerome question again.

31:42 - Jerome Pimmel 
I mean, on the cadence side, it's not really that much. On the EVM side, there's going to be a bunch of stuff coming up, but that's only going to help the EVM builders. So in terms of higher level indexing capabilities and stuff like that to be built on the cadence side, It's not, there's not a lot that we are, certainly not the foundation has in a plan. It's always been viewed as something that kind of sits, you know, kind of, it's more in the purview of other teams that would build on top of the core infrastructure rather than us having to stand all of that infrastructure up ourselves.

32:18 - Jerome Pimmel 
And things like event streaming makes all of that a lot easier for people who are building compared to what we had before. So the story of how you solve this problem is more straightforward than it's ever been. But yeah, it's not some, I don't believe there's any plans to do anything sort of higher level at any more sort of source on top at the moment.

32:37 - Tom Haile 
Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, building dApps on EVM side, people have a tendency to depend on existing services that have been in the ecosystem for a while.

32:49 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah, Geo. Yeah, I kind of wonder, because there are a couple of use cases, I think, that have come up that might be helpful for us to just try building. Like, for example, a snapshot tool is one that's come up frequently. And I know that the data is out there, because Flipside just has a database of all the cadence events.

33:11 - Giovanni Sanchez 
But yeah, I wonder if looking at specific use cases would be helpful for us to kind of figure out where the holes are in the existing tooling.

33:21 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, the, my understanding. So the, the Absolute need of a snapshot tool. Right. So voting, voting off chain, that kind of thing is because on chain was very expensive. So if EVM is going to be cheap, just build on chain stuff and cadence is cheap. Just build it on.

33:45 - Tom Haile 
Looking like on the evm side Is that will definitely impact? In users Do you have any idea drum?

33:52 - Jerome Pimmel 
Has that been worked out at gas cost? Yeah, I mean, I think it's been I think it's been written up somewhere. Um, it's gonna be it's been gonna be more than cadence less than things like Comparable evm offerings. That's kind of what they're shooting for. Um, so I I think they're comparing to things like base and Arbitrum and things like that for their transactions And so, and rather than things like Ethereum, because, you know, that's the more expensive version of everything at the moment.

34:21 - Jerome Pimmel 
And so, yeah, I'll try and I can pull it up and we can, I think it's either been, I think it's been written up somewhere, but maybe, I don't know if it's been made shared publicly yet. I think we might still be working it out. That might be it.

34:35 - Tom Haile 
It's something like that. Okay, good. It makes sense. If you've done the math after the Dan Coon upgrade, then you're probably okay. Because they've seen, L2s have seen a reduction of like 80% in fees. So 500 ETH per day down to 100 ETH per day for roll-ups and all that kind of stuff. And then that savings has been propagated up through optimism and base and all that kind of stuff. So fees have really dramatically dropped on these L2s, L3s and that kind of thing.

35:11 - Peter Argue 
Cool. I know it should have did review all of the numbers after that happened. So I think that's a kind of four.

35:21 - Tom Haile 
All right, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Anybody have any questions about data availability, queryability, building dApps, or anything like that? I think you covered the things I had in mind. Anything you want to add, Peter Drum?

35:38 - Peter Argue 
Um, so we made some changes in the last few months to some of the streaming endpoints. So that's something to look out for. So specifically, we added streaming for blocks and improved streaming for Well, I guess we updated the interfaces and made some small improvements for events. And then added an endpoint for sending a transaction and then subscribing to the result. So you'll get a streaming feed of updates as they come in.

36:15 - Peter Argue 
And then another one for subscribing to events for an account. So you could subscribe to all of the like token deposits and things like that. So those are all implemented on the gRPC side. We need to implement them for REST, but they are available on the network starting with the Crescendo launch.

36:44 - Tom Haile 
Okay. Yeah. My immediate thought is, is there going to be impact to FCL? Are, is there any breaking changes that FCL needs to be aware of, or changes that FCL needs to migrate to, to get better performance or whatever?

37:00 - Peter Argue 
No breaking changes. These are all additions. We are deprecating the old endpoints, but no immediate plans to remove them. We've switched to, I guess, on the gRPC side, on the REST side, we haven't made any changes. So that's going to continue to work. And so FCL uses REST. Um, so it's not going to really impact.

37:23 - Tom Haile 
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. That's good. Good to hear.

37:28 - Jerome Pimmel 
All right. One other thing, which is very early stage. Um, but because of EVM and we're integrating analytics and block explorers and stuff, and they want, and there's a whole bunch of things coming up for that, that we're talking to partners about, um, we're actually three, we're kind of looking at the sort of flow block chain history problem across multiple spokes and it not being contiguous in some slightly different ways because we're kind of being forced to a bit.

37:56 - Jerome Pimmel 
And whilst we don't have completely any concrete solution and proposal here yet, we might be coming up, we might be unpacking that a little bit more than we have in the past. And it'd be cool if we could solve the access to the history data problem in a nice, in a clean way. But no promises, but it's something we're starting to re-investigate.

38:19 - Tom Haile 
That's good to know. That's good to know.

38:23 - Tom Haile 
Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure. The availability and for that, that timeframe, I just think of trading, you know, someone wants to know what their P and L is over the past, whatever. So they're trading or whatever. Anyway. So interesting. Interesting. Let's see. Let's see. I think Next thing we got is just kind of existing tools. Who in the community is building stuff that they need support on? You know, either data availability or maybe some tools that we're actively developing on, you know, the CLI or anything of that nature.

39:04 - Tom Haile 
Anybody want to say anything about that or tools that are missing, something that we need to focus on?

39:18 - Tom Haile 
Okay.

39:20 - Giovanni Sanchez 
No one's got anything. Yeah. I have one that, uh, is not more current if I think it's, um, I, I feel like there's. With, um, developers coming in and as they start to interact with, uh, flow CLI flow native tooling, and if they're going to be deploying or interacting with EDM, um, I could see a potential tooling gap, um, in.

39:52 - Giovanni Sanchez 
contracts that are on either side, and kind of switching between Flow, CLI, and Foundry. And I wonder if there's any opportunity for us to, and maybe there aren't any concrete ideas, but just a way of thinking about how our tooling might interact with either existing EVM tooling or might more tightly integrate with the EVM side of things.

40:21 - Unidentified Speaker 
Hmm.

40:21 - Tom Haile 
That's a cross VM integration.

40:25 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah.

40:26 - Tom Haile 
Do you have a, you have a use case?

40:29 - Giovanni Sanchez 
You have an exact example? Sure. Um, so one example is, um, Uh, so I guess testing, right? So if I want to do integration tests between my solidity contracts and my cadence contracts, I'm basically doing that entirely from, um, kind of like have separate test repos. And so what I'll probably end up doing is I'll have to write my integration tests using like overflow, which is like a go based interaction suite.

41:04 - Giovanni Sanchez 
So things like that, I guess it it's not anything that I haven't been able to like solve. I have my solidity tests, I have my cadence tests, and I kind of like test them independently. But I'm finding that I would like to more like a fully encapsulated test. The other thing is deploying contracts and you have to think about it more. I'll try to think of more concrete use cases.

41:38 - Chase Fleming 
Chase, you have some input? I mean, yeah, I agree. I mean, I don't think, I don't have a solution for it yet, Gio, but I don't think the current state is ideal, right? I mean, currently, you'd be like, oh, we'll make a mono repo or something. And in this one, you should be using Web3.js and hard hat. In this one, you should be using our tools. I don't think that that's something that is ideal for people to recommend.

42:06 - Chase Fleming 
I see a world where it's like, you only need the existing tooling if you're like OpenSea coming, and you deploy your contract, and then you're kind of whatever. But I guess also on the other side, if you're going to go build an app, maybe that's already there. And you want to interact with it, maybe you're just going from the flow standard. But I do think that there is some sort of overlap that needs to be accounted for, whether that's in CLI aspect or FCL.

42:29 - Chase Fleming 
And maybe there's just Web3.js functions that are wrapped, so you don't have to use Web3 and FCL. I know Jordan's doing some thinking on this right now. So I don't want to speak on that too much. But yeah, is there some sort of solve there? I think we should sort of figure out what the use cases are and then try to see what we can do to address those. So if you have certain problems, like write them down and put them on a doc and start thinking about them more and how do we sort of get that overlap to be a little bit more smooth so you don't have to be jumping between two different worlds, right?

43:12 - Tom Haile 
That would be Cadence, Cadence Aware, that kind of thing. And then you would write TypeScript to integrate those two environments, that kind of thing.

43:22 - Tom Haile 
But that's just off the top of my head. Cool, that's a good call out. That's a very good call out. So I would put that kind of under, like you said, missing tooling, or could be tooling improvements to our existing infrastructure. I think that's basically all I got for this particular agenda, or all we put together for this meeting agenda. Anybody have any thoughts that came up as we were in discussion?

43:52 - Giovanni Sanchez 
I did have one more. Yeah, yeah. So all of Bridge contracts are probably one of the more complex contracts that we will have deployed in Cadence and written up in Cadence. And so the deployment of that is relatively manual. Again, I could use overflow to just automate the deployment and standing up of all the infrastructure, the contract infrastructure that needs to be deployed. But that would be different than, for example, the cadence test setup.

44:25 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Ideally, what I would do is I would write the setup once, and I would test against that setup. And I can do that just in the testing environment with cadence and the testing framework.

44:34 - Giovanni Sanchez 
reconfigure that, or basically refactor that for whatever scripting I would do with overflow if I wanted to automate that. The need for this came up when Jan was like, OK, how do I deploy the contracts? OK, well, you have to deploy what's in the flow, deploy, and then manually execute these transactions and all that stuff, and then hope that you didn't introduce the wrong argument or do the transactions in the wrong order.

45:01 - Giovanni Sanchez 
So if there was some way that I could codify or basically stand up the contract infrastructure across different networks the same way I do in the test environment and do that once, that would be really nice to have. And I would have way more confidence in something like that, that I could just have other people review and then execute that one gigantic stand-up script. That would be would be nice to get to in the future.

45:37 - Tom Haile 
Well, things like this infrastructure would need to be added to the emulator as well, just so that people could have the full environment to test against if they're going to use the bridge.

45:50 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Is that going to be available?

45:53 - Tom Haile 
Like having the bridge in an emulator? Yeah.

45:56 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Is that going to be even a thing?

45:59 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah, I think the first steps would be, I think it would probably make sense maybe behind a flag when I run flow emulator bridge enabled or something like that. In order to get these contracts integrated with the emulator, I know that I have to make some go packages based on the existing contracts, which once all of the contracts are now that they're pretty much complete and ready to audit, that's a place that I'll have to direct my time.

46:35 - Giovanni Sanchez 
to be able to have that functionality in the emulator.

46:40 - Tom Haile 
Yeah. It does seem interesting if the CLI could deploy Solidity contracts on the EVM side of the emulator. It seems like that would be a thing that we would want to support. Thanks, Deniz.

47:01 - Tom Haile 
Jason, Jordan, y'all can think about that if that's a feature that we want to support in the CLI.

47:09 - Chase Fleming 
Let's spend some time to chat about it more so we can more deeply understand it.

47:15 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, definitely.

47:19 - Peter Argue 
I have one thought that I could, it's not so much something to do right now, but just a seed to plant with y'all. So now that we have, execution data available on access nodes. It's possible for someone to realistically build a generic resource tracker. So one of the things that one of the major gaps on flow is if I want to know who all owns this NFT or you know what was the Ownership history of this NFT or you know who are the token holders for flow or whatever you have to individually Index all of that and query it and you mentioned earlier like the snapshot of like how do I know?

48:07 - Peter Argue 
Who owned this at this block? So with the execution data you get basically a picture of all of the changes block to block of the state on chain and And so you could consume that and track the movement of resources throughout the blockchain and you could do it in a way that you could see things embedded. For instance, if you put a vault in an NFT and transfer the NFT, you could figure that out more easily because it's not based on events solely.

48:45 - Peter Argue 
to build something like this, but it's technically possible to do it now. The data is available to be able to do it now. So if anyone wants a hackathon project or is finding a community team looking for something to work on, this could be something cool.

49:08 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, that's super cool. That's super cool. That's been asked for umpteen million times. That's super cool.

49:19 - Tom Haile 
All right. I'd say it's definitely an ecosystem-wide tool people would be very interested in.

49:26 - Peter Argue 
Yeah. It would be awesome to find a community team that would be willing to build it as an open source so that anyone could pick that up and then build a product around it or tooling around it.

49:40 - Peter Argue 
Could even be some kind of grant or something like that. I mentioned it here just to get your gears turning around it, see if you come up with any ideas or how we can make it happen.

49:52 - Tom Haile 
There we go. All right, that sounds great. And we would have picked that up in our read AI. So that would be in the transcript. That would be awesome. All right, cool. Anybody have anything else?

50:15 - Jordan Ribbink 
No, I mean there was one last little thing for Geo maybe. I know when Chase and I were looking at some of the testing, Cadence testing framework stuff the other day, there were just like some oddities I guess with like deploying contracts and like you have to specify paths for your contracts still when they're already kind of known by the CLI. And just some general things in terms of writing tests that we weren't really sure about, if this was really easy for users to understand out of the box, I guess.

50:53 - Jordan Ribbink 
So I guess what I might ask is if you had any other feedback like you were saying, Um, on the cadence testing framework that, that, you know, you think this isn't quite right. That isn't quite right. If, if we can maybe try and document some of these things, um, cause like, yeah, I mean, I can only see so much, right. Like I don't use it every day like you do, but just this off the bat was kind of weird to me.

51:14 - Jordan Ribbink 
And if it's weird to me, it's probably weird to other people as well.

51:19 - Chase Fleming 
Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up, Jordan. So if you like, look at this, I've just had the demo or here. So what Jordan's talking about is that. You have to hard code all these paths and the name of these. And it seems kind of completely unnecessary. And I guess why even deploy the contract? Because if you're testing in a project with flow JSON, why not just deploy them all for testing? And then you could just do default contract write, ignore having to have any of this here, and then just do, I don't know the exact.

51:57 - Chase Fleming 
Syntax would be like, you know, like whatever default contract, just this is the way it works with code anyway, right? Like, what is it not? Is that correct, Jordan?

52:12 - Jordan Ribbink 
Am I illustrating what you're talking about?

52:17 - Jordan Ribbink 
Yeah, the big thing to me was the path thing. In terms of the deployment, I think we still might need that control over it, right? Because if you want dynamic arguments and to test how your contract reacts to certain arguments being deployed at certain times, etc., you might want some more control over it. So I don't know if we have the ability to deploy by default. But in terms of the path stuff, that was just something, like I said, right off the bat that was weird to me.

52:49 - Jordan Ribbink 
And I'm sure there's other things. So yeah. I mean, anything we can do to surface this tool a little bit better, make it a little more usable would be great.

53:00 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. There's a couple of things. I think the path makes sense. I would prefer to have control over when in sequence, I think, things are deployed from within the test environment. But one other thing that I have thought would be really helpful, and I think there's a workaround that would be available that you could use with the existing test stuff is being able to mock. So I can have smaller unit tests.

53:27 - Giovanni Sanchez 
The other thing that would be nice is being able to mock where in scope I'm actually making a function So if something is like access account, right? I'm not really able to Test that directly and the functionality of that call directly because it has to be executed from some like other account contract defined Context so being able to kind of like switch up the context from which I'm making calls would be really nice But that's probably more like in-depth.

53:59 - Giovanni Sanchez 
It sounds like changing the path for example would be like a kind So probably best to just like write down the things that I've noticed and maybe put it in a GitHub issue.

54:17 - Jordan Ribbink 
Yeah, and I guess like one of the other things I ran into a while back now that I'm thinking about this was kind of like a lack of, I guess, standard library for trying to write some of these tests. Like I was trying to test like FCL crypto contract and it's like trying to test this and like make, you know, verify signatures in a test and make mock signatures and what have you was like a bit of a nightmare.

54:43 - Jordan Ribbink 
And it was like, I just kind of gave up on doing it in the cadence test framework. So my gut says that there's probably other issues standard library-wise that people are running into. And I guess, yeah, anything we can do here to give it a bit more parity with functionality available in Overflow, like you said.

55:02 - Unidentified Speaker 
Cool.

55:06 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, and probably if we don't have a pattern, we should probably use an existing pattern that EVM and Solidity contract developers already know. We just kind of, you know, lift, shift, and implement on the cadence side from that tooling perspective.

55:28 - Jerome Pimmel 
Yeah, I mean, I think when you mentioned signatures, I mean, that could always be pretty thorny anyway, right? That's a pretty special little place of, you know, and yeah, so it's probably that's probably never really been investigated thoroughly. But yeah, I think that that stands out as, you know, probably somewhere that would be worth potentially investing, but possibly quite tricky to.

55:51 - Tom Haile 
That's a good point.

55:54 - Tom Haile 
Does the crypto library still fail if the user doesn't have a thousand weight signature, even though the signature validates?

56:04 - Jordan Ribbink 
Oh man, I think so. I think you give it an array of signatures, and if those add up to a thousand, it's true. If those don't add up to a thousand, it's false. I think that's how it goes. I mean, I don't know what your reasoning would be for wanting to verify signatures with weight less than a thousand, because if you've Signed with a weight less than a thousand you don't own the account and for all intents and purposes you have no control over the account right so I'm not sure what the use case is there.

56:38 - Tom Haile 
My use case was signing a message just to prove that the signature is valid it wasn't for transactions.

56:48 - Jordan Ribbink 
Yeah, but I guess he would tell you there that your signature to that message carries no weight. Nobody should take that for being true because you don't have sufficient weight on the account, right?

57:01 - Tom Haile 
True, true. I just thought that was interesting. This is way back when I was working on, I don't know, the case tool or whatever it was. Anyway, okay, cool. But yeah, good point.

57:14 - Tom Haile 
I think, are we at time? We're almost at time. Anybody have any, any other thoughts or any discussions for next, next meeting?

57:26 - Tom Haile 
Do you think we sufficiently covered data availability? And then maybe subsequent discussions, subsequent meetings would be more about tooling and stuff that exists or as it becomes more available and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Gene. Cool. What, from the next meeting thing, part of the ecosystem wide cooling, what do you think will be the breaking point if we had 10,000 dads show up and just like want to do stuff in the, in the flow ecosystem?

57:59 - Tom Haile 
What do you think would break or be, be very apparent as missing besides the data availability piece?

58:10 - Tom Haile 
And we talked about cross VM integration and testing and deployment. We talked about that. Anybody think of anything?

58:26 - Giovanni Sanchez 
I guess maybe the something that has emerged from the community is I know as a flows course contracts for applications to kind of like integrate into their existing. And maybe that's just for like solving the same problem that the CLI dependency manager, the contract manager is trying to solve. But I wonder if that exists like higher up the stack.

58:59 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, we talked about that a little bit, Gio, about npm package where you get all the addresses for core contracts and then you just, the developers can just.

59:11 - Tom Haile 
And it would populate the string imports for Aden's contracts and stuff. And then we talked about, well, Flex will have the addresses in them, so you don't have to worry about it. And then my thought process was, well, If I'm going to be rate limited on number of scripts I could run I want to pack as much Scripting into one query and then therefore the maybe the flex pack pre-packaged Scripts doesn't really help me because I instead of running 10 just want to run one and then blah blah So then I would need to know all the addresses and all that kind of stuff Anyway, that's kind of where my mind's been been racing racing, too And so, um, if we did have NPM packages that did everything that application developers would need, then, then it'd be pretty easy to integrate.

59:59 - Tom Haile 
But as soon as they step out of that known happy path, then it's like chaos.

1:00:07 - Giovanni Sanchez 
Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Um, the other thing that's, that's come up around, um, like I think I mostly have found it from incoming messages about partners wanting to refactor like really basic operations. Like, I don't know, how do I give me a transaction that allows me to change the key or revoke a key or add a key or create account and add a that you would want to do on a flow account. We don't have a repo that I'm aware of where you could find all of those operations.

1:00:42 - Giovanni Sanchez 
So maybe it's a matter of spinning up the template service again.

1:00:46 - Tom Haile 
And maybe that's where we house all of these really standard are in the core contracts, uh, repo jock put together and, um, there's, uh, scripts and transactions. One specifically ad key account. Yeah. Uh, chase.

1:01:06 - Chase Fleming 
Are there, um, are they trying to do this from what, because I was thinking too, at some point I was like, if there's just enough, like generic things that are common enough, like not related to other contracts and stuff, but if they're doing it from the CLI, like, and it doesn't exist. I'm getting to the point, and I know some people have different opinions on this, where I don't mind putting some cadence in for just some really common things, like, hey, flow transfer flow, or flow add key, or flow whatever.

1:01:38 - Chase Fleming 
And so if that would simplify and make things easier on some level, we could put in common things into the CLI that might help so that people don't have to actually get a whole cadence file, run a script or a transaction, you know, things like get total supply or whatever it might be. Like if there was a, if people could put together a list of like 10 common things that partners are trying to do and if they were, if it would help them from the CR, like, um, you can have that discussion about just literally putting it, putting them in there and then yeah, stuff beyond that.

1:02:14 - Chase Fleming 
Um, you know, probably need something different, but like for whatever the most basic things are.

1:02:21 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, we can gen flicks, and then just use the CLI to run those flicks and kind of wrap it with a convenience method. And then we don't have to worry about embedding a bunch of patents in flow CLI, that kind of stuff. And we'll need those flicks anyway, especially if we integrate them with the Flowport stuff.

1:02:45 - Giovanni Sanchez 
But yeah, that makes sense. This is like a totally half-baked idea I just had as you're riffing on that, Jace. It'd be cool if I could set an alias to a flix that I know and include that behind a CLI command.

1:03:06 - Giovanni Sanchez 
So that way, I can almost create my own custom commands in the CLI scripts and transactions that I'm familiar with and I've set with an alias.

1:03:18 - Tom Haile 
We do have a proposal for that for when Flix would move on-chain, then you can just use the alias, the name of it. And then the CLI would go and look up that alias and then run the Flix for you. And then on-chain they could be iterated on if need be. And the alias brings up But the reason why, sorry.

1:03:40 - Chase Fleming 
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, that brings up a larger problem with them. That needs to be addressed in the Flix thing, which is the discovery aspect. I don't know how I feel about custom aliases and stuff. We should probably talk about that separately. But I mean, I think the first step and like it isn't like the technical implementation we can talk about but like the first step is just knowing like what are the 10 most common things that people are trying to do that they're having a pain doing right so if we get that um then I think that would be a good first step very good point yeah and then uh for account management I think flowport essentially was Was meant

1:04:29 - Tom Haile 
to help with that And I don't I don't think it's well organized in order to you can like add keys remove keys and all that kind of stuff but that can be another place to Put these common tools for partners and stuff like that might want to do a very specific thing once You know what? I mean are you know, like once a year or something like that? So it might be good just to have a web interface different than if they want to create a service and, and wrap these, these account management tasks.

1:05:00 - Tom Haile 
Like if they were a custodial service or something like that, that'd be different, but it could come up. I think that's it. We're over time. Thanks guys. Really appreciate it. See you in two weeks. Good stuff.

1:05:17 - Chase Fleming 
Hi everyone. Thanks for, for running at Tom.

1:05:19 - Jerome Pimmel 
Appreciate it.

1:05:20 - Unidentified Speaker 
Thanks. Thanks. Bye.

1:05:25 - Tom Haile 
All right, that's it.

1:05:27 - Alexandr Ni 
I don't want to stay here to discuss that thing.

1:05:31 - Tom Haile 
Yeah, let me turn off the read AI thing right quick. How do I do that? Let's see. I hope it continues to. Let's close down and then jump back on.

1:05:44 - Alexandr Ni 
Wait, I think I can just move it like this.

1:05:47 - Unidentified Speaker 
Yeah, I was wondering.
