Summary:

The meeting began with Tom Haile leading a discussion on technical updates and agenda items, covering the current status of the bridge and data availability, as well as the focus on OKRs and the delay in the testnet migration timeline. Giovanni Sanchez added insights on the on-chain randomness for EVM and the status of the bridge's PR for deployment to PreviewNet. Additionally, Tom Haile mentioned the ongoing work on Flowport, including the creation of COA addresses and the transfer of assets across the bridge, with an emphasis on providing a demo for testing soon. Chase provided a status update on the contract manager, contributing to the overall technical progress and developments within the team.

The team then discussed the challenges and opportunities related to data availability and query ability for end user applications, particularly focusing on the limitations and capabilities of access nodes. The conversation revolved around the rollout of local script execution onto public nodes and the challenges related to memory and compute contention issues. Peter Argue provided insights into the availability of resources and rate limits for users on public nodes, as well as the enterprise plan offered by QuickNode for larger dApps. The team also discussed the EVM access plan, emphasizing the need for load testing and sizing before transitioning to QuickNode to ensure smooth operation.

The team also discussed various issues with the Cadence testing framework, including the need to specify paths for contracts, the lack of control over deployment sequence, and challenges in testing certain functionalities. They emphasized the importance of improving documentation, adding more control over deployment, and enhancing the standard library to make the framework more accessible and functional for users. Additionally, they suggested leveraging existing patterns from EVM and Solidity contract development to enhance the usability of the Cadence testing framework.

Finally, the team engaged in a detailed discussion about the integration of core contracts for application developers and the need for standard operations such as adding, revoking, and changing keys. They also considered the possibility of including common operations in the CLI to simplify tasks for partners, and explored the idea of creating custom commands and aliases in the CLI for familiar scripts and transactions. Additionally, they touched upon the potential challenges and benefits of moving Flix on-chain and the need for a well-organized web interface for account management tasks. The meeting concluded with Tom expressing gratitude and setting the next meeting date.
