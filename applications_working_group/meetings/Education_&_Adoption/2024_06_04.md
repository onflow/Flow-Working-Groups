# Meeting 7

## Date: June 4th, 2024, 11-12 PM PST

## Questions

Any interesting things we've seen in the wild?

- interactive init on project setup (flow CLI)

  - 0 to 1 in a matter of 5 minutes

- Cryptoids having a cross-chain marketplace, could pentientally work with evm on Flow

- Flunks launched NFT. Staking "backpack" will recieve $GUM

- discussions around Toucans work and the onboarding

- Asked commmunity members to see if we can get some educational videos

- asked about "storage fees". Confusing concept for newer folks

- possible videos about account models into education

- possible short explainer videos of each big concept unique to Cadence

## Priorities

- massive outreach program to get folks onto staging migration

- try not to anncounce things too early, especially with the staging migration is ready

  - ex. NFT contract wasn't ready yet after announcement

- communications around deadlines is still not great

  - maybe put banners/warnings on wallets as well
  - might get the developers to push to get their contracts upgraded

- some folks don't use flow CLI to deploy, and have to learn flow CLI in order to run the stage migration

## Todays Agenda

- Staging on Mainnet education - retro from educational material/content related to Testnet and how we can best prepare for educating people about staging on Mainnet.
- Error Messages path (discuss next time)
- Dependency Manager GTM/Educational material. (discuss next time)
