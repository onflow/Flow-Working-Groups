# Cadence Language and Execution Working Group

## Intro
Cadence Language and Execution Working Group is an open-for-all forum with a focus on Flow's Smart Contract programming language ([Cadence](https://cadence-lang.org/)) and itâ€™s execution environment.

### Objectives
* Build the best programming language for developers to safely and efficiently explore new applications of smart contracts and on-chain logic.
* Represent and promote Cadence in a wider software development and Web3 community.

### History
Cadence Working Group started as "Cadence Language Design Meetings" (LDM) - series of meetings focusing on the implementation of Cadence programming language that started in July 2022. You can access all notes from those meetings in the ["meetings" directory in the Cadence Repository](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/meetings).
In the Early 2024 the purpose of the working group was expanded to also cover topics related to Cadence runtime enviroment, a component of Flow Execution Node.
