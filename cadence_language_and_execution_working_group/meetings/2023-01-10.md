## FLIPs

### Capability Controllers

[https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798)

* Status:
    * Final API discussions
    * TODO:
        * Compatibility with AuthAccount capabilities and Inbox API
        * Emit events
* Open problems:
    * None
* Next steps:
    * Vote!

### Auth fields and Safe Downcasting

[https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54)

* Status:
    * New
    * Spearheaded by Daniel, Dete, and Kate
    * Discuss proposal
* Open problems:
    * Migration is complex and widespread

### Attachments

[https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/11](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/11)

[https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2)

* Status:
    * Approved and implemented
    * Preview release available to try out the new feature
* Next steps:
    * Implement iteration
        * This depends on whether we have safe downcasting as an alternative for reflection (see above, [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54))
    * Allow declaring an attachment for restricted types ("set of interfaces") [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2224](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2224)
    * Attachment access control based on base resource access
        * Depends on [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54)

### Interface Inheritance

[https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40)

[https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-interface-inheritance-in-cadence/3750](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-interface-inheritance-in-cadence/3750)

* Status:
    * Had separate break-out sessions, will need another one
    * Implementation complete for the proposal. Would need changes for the parts of the proposal that would change.
    * Sentiment is positive for need
    * Blocker is details (default functions, in particular)
    * Ideas currently being discussed:
        * Forbid interface changes
        * Change default function

* Open questions:
    * Meeting notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUvRg0T09mdE2Ndgti6xI1AY_KPYGJr2ZRLVuqzGxFg/edit#heading=h.d4wc1pr484vi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUvRg0T09mdE2Ndgti6xI1AY_KPYGJr2ZRLVuqzGxFg/edit#heading=h.d4wc1pr484vi)

* Next steps:
    * Schedule another session
    * Is this still a blocker for NFT/FT v2?

### Extend transaction format
[https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41)

* Status:
    * Got some feedback, needs more
    * Large proposal affecting many components
    * Small change, big (good) implications
    * Had break-out sessions, resolved some open questions
    * Need to resolve remaining open questions

* Open problems:
    * No concrete solution, many possibilities, proposal has just one incomplete solution
    * Solution a bit more concrete (e.g. block syntax)
    * Unclear how wallets code-gen and insert parts into transaction

* Next steps:
    * Get more feedback
    * Another Breakout session
    * Prioritize over e.g. reentrancy and external mutability improvements
    * Start with prototyping in Cadence (parsing and type checking)

### AuthAccount capabilities

* [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/53](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/53)

* Status
    * Had break-out session
    * Child account model is really useful
    * However, should make it "harder" to perform such administrative tasks (linking account capability), also other operations like adding keys
    * At the same time: add safe-guards, require "sudo" signature

* Open problems:
    * Safe guards
    * Once available, wallets need to support for safe guards (e.g. flag "sudo" transaction to user)

* Next steps:
    * Wait with approval of FLIP until safe-guards are available
    * Start on discussion for "sudo" operations in forum, evtl. have FLIP
    * Enable on Testnet to enable demo/development of ecosystem

## Other items for Stable Cadence?

[https://forum.onflow.org/t/the-path-to-stable-cadence/2702](https://forum.onflow.org/t/the-path-to-stable-cadence/2702)

We're mainly looking for changes, especially breaking ones.
We'll prioritize additional features after Stable Cadence.

* Type aliases

* Enable non-facade capability patterns, e.g. attenuation "building blocks"
    * Currently possible, but heavy-weight (e.g. defining new type)
    * Sugar for e.g. adding pre and post conditions, wrapping, filtering, etc. around methods for an object
    * → auth modifier FLIP
    * → CapCon FLIP

* Consumption of `self`
    * Currently: `resource R { fun foo() { … } }`
    * Implicitly: `resource R { fun foo(self: auth &R) { … } }`
    * Could be explicit: `resource R { fun foo(self: @R) { … } }`

* Cannot return/export certain types, cannot emit events
    * Used to be a problem for function types, references, etc.
    * Should be resolved now, please report non-exportable issues
    * Maybe add ability to override serialization, e.g. allow export of function call value

* Related: Allow import of any value in script (e.g. resource, capability)

* Import just deserialize
    * `struct Foo { let bar: Int; init(bar: Int) { pre { self.bar > 0 } { … } }`
    * Currently allow e.g. `{"type": “Foo”, “bar”: 0}`
    * Call initializer instead?
    * Maybe allow either/or

* Block access to certain read-only functions?
    * Data is assumed to be public
    * Minimize EN’s exclusive access/knowledge

* Broken contracts
    * Skip in storage iteration
    * Might just be partially broken
    * → General problem/idea: Catch panics and resume
        * Issues:
            * Implementation complexity (snapshotting/rollback in storage system, in-memory objects, etc.)
            * Security problems (assumption of rollback)
        * Could allow in scripts
    * Maybe nested transactions?
        * Currently only have nested transactions, no rollback/resumption
    * Recovery:
        * Would be case-by-case (parsing, type checking, conformance, casting failure, etc.)
        * Could e.g. allow reading of fields of stored data, disallow function calls. Useful?

## Nested type requirements → emit events in interfaces?

* FT/NFT standards v2
* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1283](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1283)
* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2081](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2081)
* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2069](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2069)

## Allow deletion of storage values with broken types?
