## External Mutability

- FLIP that prevents external mutation was approved, implemented, and released in Secure Cadence:
  [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/703](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/703)
- Open problems:
  - Composites were not covered by the FLIP, only arrays and dictionaries
  - Externally taking a reference to a field can circumvent the external mutability restriction
- New FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1056](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1056)
  - Purity/mutability modifier for functions
  - Automatic analysis to determine if function has side-effects

## Condition can currently have side effects
- https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1805
- Might be used for underhanded code: Post-condition might perform mutation. Example: FT withdrawal
- Might be solved by purity FLIP
- Can a pure function emit events?
  - Does affect on-chain state, but is not observable
- Are other side-effecting functons like debugging logging allowed?
- "Pure" vs "no side-effects"
  - "Pure" usually means no side-effects at all
  - Have to be pragmatic
- Alternatives:
  - Prevent calls in general
  - Run-time errors if there are side-effects

## Remove deprecated key API
- We currently have two key management APIs:
  - `AuthAccount.addPublicKey`/`AuthAccount.removePublicKey`:
    - Low-level, accepts encoded key as byte array
    - Deprecated a year ago
  - [`AuthAccount.keys.add`](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/#add-account-keys)/`AuthAccount.keys.remove`
    - High-level, accepts key as object (`PublicKey`)
    - Added a year ago
- We attempted to remove the deprecated in the Secure Cadence release
  - Rolled back, as it will break client applications if they use SDK which uses deprecated API
- Also: Events that are emitted when a key is added is inconsistent, depends on which API is used: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1796
- Do we have metrics on how many SDKs are still using the deprecated API?
- Actionables:
  - Add deprecation annotation to developer tooling
    - Pragma, e.g. `#deprecated`
    - Comment, e.g. `@deprecated`
    - Add support in VS Code, render as ~~addPublicKey~~

## Interface default methods
- https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1076
- Proposed for NFT metadata standard
- Helps with preventing breakage in ecosystem
- Avoid copy/paste and boilerplate, making code reusable
- Does not help with FT/NFT rewrite proposal
- Useful for utility/convenience functions, reducing boilerplate
- Open Questions:
  - Security implications?
    - Related:
      - Post-conditions with side-effects
      - Mutability
        - Restrict to pure functions? Potentially too restrictive, e.g. couldnâ€™t provide
        - Maybe allow opt out of mutating functions. But could also be used to opt-out of a fix
    - Examples?
    - Trust relationship problem
      - Already have this problem with contract updates
    - Modification of default implementation
    - Would be useful to provide utility functions, like FT transfer
    - It should not be possible to perform malicious code, as the same could be done in a non-default function
- Not a breaking change, could merge and ship before Stable Cadence
- When there is a conflict, e.g multiple interfaces provide default implementation:
  - No "winner" is selected by default
  - Instead, the user is required to provide an implementation
- Follow up feature: Interface requirements
  - Declaration site: `CI1: CI2`
  - Use-site would still have to explicitly declare conformance for all interfaces: `C: CI1, CI2`

## Storage Querying/Iteration API
- https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/208
- Finally added technical foundation a couple months ago:
  Account storage data is now stored in [atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree) values
  (atree is Cadence's storage layer)
- Issue lays out proposal for adding API to iterate over account paths/values
- Outstanding issues:
  - Accounts may store a lot of data. Pagination iteration? Iterator, cursor, enumerator
  - Concrete API proposal
- First use-case: Developer tools like the Emulator and Playground
- Need to show wallet developers how they can render information to users
- Mutability not necessarily a problem: Run script against block.
  - Problem: data availability
  - Might be solved in future by "historic" data node
- Storage Layer:
  - Iteration over dictionary changes when mutated
  - Keys are hashed
- Start with MVP
- Stages:
  - 1. Even useful if pagination problem is not solved yet
  - 2. Pagination for larger accounts
  - 3. Support for handling mutation
- Also useful for e.g. dictionary, keys. Might be too large
  - Keys on demand
  - E.g. useful to pick a random key

## Organisational

- Should we move this meeting so it is not on a Friday evening for folks in Europe?
  - Not Friday, not Monday
  - Tuesday is best
  - Same time (8am PT)
