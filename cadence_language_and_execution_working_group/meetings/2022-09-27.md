## FLIPs

* **Capability Controllers:**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798
    * Status: had meeting; scope clear, API design
    * Open problems:
        * None, mainly just API design
    * Next steps:
        * Move forward with API details

* **Publish and Claim Capabilities**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1122
    * Status: meeting resolved outstanding questions
    * Open problems:
        * None for FLIP, but related: might need improve event API
    * Next steps:
        * Have a final look

* **Extensibility**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1101
    * Status: Had meeting, still unclear what approach is best
    * Open problems:
        * Problem with extensions approach: changes in extension and extended type break code
        * Use case: metadata
        * Alternative: attachment-style proposal; requires iteration
    * Next steps:
        * Alternative FLIP for attachments
        * Compare with existing extensions FLIP
        * Pick one or find compromise

* **Add fields during contract update**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097
    * Status: No update
    * Open problems:
        * Implementation details for migration (not impossible, just needs to be laid out)
    * Next steps:
        * Call?

* **Invalidate references to transferred resources:**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043
    * Status:
        * Agreement for need
        * Prototype implementation: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1999
        * Agreement that any transfer (even stack-to-stack) invalidates
    * Open problems:
        * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043#issuecomment-1258742270
        * Maybe use stack depth check?
    * Next steps:
        * Analyze impact: analysis pass (also useful for breaking change analysis; hard to check)
    * Note: this is about ephemeral references (lifetime of a transaction/script), not capabilities

* **Borrow Contract**
    * https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071
    * Status:
        * Complete
        * Needs minor edits
        * Have reference implementation: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1934
    * Open problems:
        * Concern that static analysis is not possible anymore resolved, already have run-time imports of contracts
        * Concern for cache invalidation - implementation detail, not a concern, functionality basically already available
    * Next steps:
        * Needs approval/rejection

## Contract removal
* Was available until Secure Cadence release
* Problem: Removal + addition allows circumventing updatability checks
    * E.g. change field type, change type kind, etc.
* Currently disabled, as it is unclear how to implement this safely
* Options:
    * Don't have removal
    * Revocation / tombstoning
    * Keep old contract information and treat addition as update
* Unavailability of removal
    * Hinders development of utility contracts
    * Unable to clean up account storage
* Removal of contracts/types might leads to breakage
* Removal useful for "temporary" types, e.g. for capability attenuation
    * Idea: Marking contracts as "public"/"internal"/"beta", cannot be shared/stored/etc
* It would be nice to have and expose instance count for types, allow removal if no instances

## Scoped AuthAccounts / Account initialization
* https://github.com/onflow/flow/issues/1131
* Solve the account initialization problem
* E.g. marketplace needs to know how to prepare user account
* Responsibility of initialization should be on dapp, not user agent
    * However, power user might want to control where e.g. collection is stored, might have multiple
    * Normally user does not care, wants "default". Still, user agent (wallet software) should take care, not contract
* Actors: user, asset creator, application developer
    * Asset creator and application developer often tied together
    * However, application developer might not be asset creator (e.g. marketplace)
* User should be in control, not asset creator or application developer. Might use user agent. Asset creator might propose requirements so it can function
* Analogy: User data vs system files (Installer asks where program should be installed)
* Scoped AuthAccount is basically attenuated AuthAccount
* Related (alternatives?):
    * Bjarte's FLIP: https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/748
    * Transaction interaction templates
    * NFT catalog
    * Return initialization information
        * NFT Metadata: [https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/9877dccbd884e06bbd754a4f693b7169dd6dd62b/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc#L480-L537](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/9877dccbd884e06bbd754a4f693b7169dd6dd62b/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc#L480-L537)
        * New NFT feature: [https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/pull/126#discussion_r981328645](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/pull/126#discussion_r981328645)
    * Declaration in prepare block (?)
    * Pass box which captures initialization
    * Enforce limitation in type system (e.g. AuthAccount restricted to just storage, only certain path, only write, etc.)
* Approach axes:
    * Limiting vs checking after the fact
    * Imperative vs declarative
* Next steps:
    * Agreement on responsibility, formalize
    * Find solution that aligns
    * Meeting with people involved with existing solutions
        * Who? Dete, Austin (after 7th), Bjarte (other FLIP), Amit (NFT catalog, NFT Collection Metadata), Jeff (interaction templates)
* Additional discussion points from Amit:
    * Fixing existing account links that have it wrong (and gracefully with an account that has it wrong). Currently its unlink -> link
    * [Metadata views] aren't very useful on-chain because you have to make custom templated transactions regardless in order to make these links because we lack a way to link at runtime (see https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1617)
    * Having a way to allow a contract owner to be more prescriptive about what setup should be done (maybe past a single public link like the view provides).
