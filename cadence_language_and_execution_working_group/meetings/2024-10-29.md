## Agenda

Agenda for this meeting will be to:

- Review, discuss and clean up open FLIPs: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/3615

- Summary of priorities for the Cadence team for this quarter

## FLIPs

- Add fields in update: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/295 
    - originally https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097
    - Dete:
       - What about updating types arbitrarily?
       - Might want to consider more general version instead of incremental
     - Deniz:
       - Against
       - Good to limit scope
       - Too complicated to implement (existing removed fields)
       - Generic extra storage in all types?
     - Supun:
       - In the proposal also define how field can be prevented from getting removed (tombstoning) first
       - Requirement to proceed
     - Josh:
       - Not very necessary, can already add fields, proposal just makes it more elegant
          - Add fields to contracts: use account storage and add getter/setter
       - "All or nothing": Allow it for all types, not just contracts
       - Implications of storing additional data in existing values, in owners' accounts
     - Who wants to champion this?
       - Follow up with Austin

- Cadence Date and Time: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/245
    - Get more feedback, currently just a draft
    - Josh:
      - Just to have a nice to have
      - Currently mostly raw Unix timestamps
    - Dete:
      - Maybe bounty, managed by DevEx team
      - Can be done purely in Cadence, does not need any internal knowlegde of or contributions to Cadence
      - Useful, but not critical
      - Low priority tag, "good first issue"

- Cadence WebAssembly API: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/256
    - PoC is fairly complete
    - TODO: limits, metering details
    - Supun:
        - Proposal is simple, "no-brainer"
        - Should metering be part of FLIP?
    - Janez:
        - Next quarter: Recalibration of computation, can include this, no extra work
        - Don't have to define metering, can mention it
        - Can overestimate fuel for now
    - Dete:
        - In favour
        - Not highest priority, but unlocks use-cases
    - Deniz:
        - In favour

- Authorized Call: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/198
    - Dete:
        - Discuss with author
        - Maybe just confused by capabilities and we need better explanation or UX around it?

- Extended Transaction Format: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41
    - Check priority with Jeff?
        - https://flow-foundation.slack.com/archives/C074F78ECNL/p1721164199515509
    - Dete:
        - Close and reopen once there is a concrete proposal
        - Currently a design discussion, not a concrete FLIP
    - Follow up with Wallet team (Jeff)
    - Not in a state where it can be implemented
    - Icebox or close

- Type removal pragma: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/276
    - Make decision
    - Supun:
        - Not as important anymore as it was during Cadence 1.0 migration, but still useful
        - Already is possible to break stored values
    - Josh:
        - Useful, but not as important as adding fields
    - Dete:
        - Protections, preventing breakage not useful
        - Need to be able to delete objects with "broken types"
        - Need mechanism to lock down contract, make contract immutable
        - Proposal does not make "breakability" problem worse (malicious developer), already multiple other mechanisms to break type
        - Adds value to non-malicious developer
    - Deniz:
        - Bad, allows breaking existing stored values of users
        - "Contract" should be **contract**
    - Gio:
        - What about storage iteration
    - Accepted

- Simple string interpolation: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/289
    - Deniz:
        - In favour, very useful
    - Supun:
        - Separate syntax to differentiate interpolating strings from normal string literals?
    - Bastian:
        - Unnecessary to have separate syntax
    - Dete:
        - Modern developers don't understand cost of strings, especially safe strings
        - We are in a constrained environment
        - Useful for scripts
        - Nervous about using strings in contracts and storage
        - Need to think more about strings in general
    - Josh:
        - Highest priority
        - Very useful for error message improvement in core contracts
    - Improves current situation
    - Accepted
    - But also: Discussion on best practices around strings

- `StructStringer` interface: https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/294
    - Discuss the concerns and make a decision
    - Deniz:
        - How to know if it's safe to call?
        - Can panic
        - Not trusted
        - In favour
    - Gio:
        - Would be an issue if used as a dictionary key
    - Supun:
    - Accepted
