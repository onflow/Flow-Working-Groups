## Agenda

Agenda:
1. Update on Cadence 1.0
  - See office hours document: https://www.notion.so/dapperlabs/Cadence-1-0-Office-Hours-680c7c63921940248380e2ffcf74b804?pvs=4#faec6830df294831b51e1c80ac55d5e5 
2. [FLIP: Improve Public Capability Acquisition](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/242)
3. Remove support for non-public access modifiers in interfaces.
  - Confusion about what it means to define a non-public (e.g. `access(contract)`) member in an interface, and how such members can be accessed from different places, e.g. in the contract defining it, in the contract implementing the interface, and what access modifiers may be used in the implementation and what they mean.
  - Came up for function in new `Burner` contract and for `NFT`'s `ownedNFTs` field
  - Current behaviour:
    - Access modifier of member in implementation must not be more restrictive than access modifier in interface
    - https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/27a49431a654438ec34b2692b9c357a8445e427b/runtime/sema/check_composite_declaration.go#L1585-L1588
    - That means an implementation may choose to use a more permissive access modifier
    - Developers however seem to want to define an access restriction in the interface
  - Interfaces are meant to allow interoverability and hiding implementation details.
    Implementing against an interface instead of a concrete type decouples code and makes it "future-compatible".
  - (Most) other languages do not support such behaviour (Java, Kotlin, Swift, Rust, etc.)
  - **Proposal:** Remove support for non-public access modifier
    - Re-adding well-defined behaviour in a future release would not be a breaking change, but removing it in future would be.
    - Very late in Cadence 1.0 process, developers have already started to stage updates and do not expect further breaking changes
    - Implementation effort is low
    - Impact on contracts?
4. Discuss forum post about [Transaction Fee Changes](https://forum.flow.com/t/proposing-transaction-fee-changes-and-flow-evm-gas-charges-for-flow-crescendo-launch/5817/7)
  - Any impacts we may have missed?
