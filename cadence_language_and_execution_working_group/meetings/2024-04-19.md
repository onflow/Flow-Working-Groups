### Update on Cadence 1.0

See office hours document: https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Cadence-1-0-Office-Hours-3f5f321dff6b47f7913018935d823846

### FLIP 242: Improve Public Capability Acquisition

https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/242

- Daniel had some more questions regarding the behaviour for when a capability is published at the requested path (it "exists"),
  but the requested type does not borrow type does not match the capability's borrow type
  - Static borrow type: use requested type
  - Capability usable until check/borrow, same as current behaviour\
- No more clarification needed
- Austin to accept suggestions
- Accept early next week if no more concerns 

### FLIP 262: Require matching access modifiers for interface implementation members

https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/263

- Previously the proposal was called "Remove support for non-public access modifiers in interfaces."
- Contained two parts:
  1. Remove support for non-public access modifiers in interfaces
  2. Require access modifiers for interface implementation members to match access modifiers in interface
- Revised proposal is only the second part.
- Feedback of revision has been positive so far
- Dete: forbid `access(account)`?
  - Scan Mainnet contracts
  - Decision would have been easier a while ago, but late in the process
- Dete: allow acccess(self)?
  - Useful for default functions
  - Like in Java
  - Allready forbidden, can add it later, after Cadence 1.0
- Accept early next week if no more concerns 

### Community able to update contracts by May 22nd?

- Austin: 
  - All contracts updated and staged, except Hybrid Custody
  - Need backward-compatible SDK
  - Need to resolve open FLIPs
