## **Mainnet spork / Cadence release**

We've achieved another big milestone! ðŸŽ‰

https://forum.onflow.org/t/cadence-updates-for-the-nov-2022-mainnet-spork/3748

## FLIPs

### Invalidate references to transferred resources

* https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043
* Status: Accepted ðŸŽ‰

###  Capability Controllers

* https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798

* Status: 
    * Figured out how to add API in backward-compatible way. 
    * Will allow deprecation instead of replacement

* Open problems:
    * None

* Next steps:
    * Vote!

### Attachments

* https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/11

* Forum discussion: https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2

* Status:
    * No feedback if extensions or attachments are preferred. Assume extensions subsumed by attachments.
    * Updated attachment proposal with feedback

* Open problems:
    * attach expression evaluation order: right-to-left. Would be nice to have natural language
        * Currently: `attach A() to <-r`
        * Probably won't matter practically
        * Require it to be view?
        * attach as postfix operator / function?
        * Functions would not require separate handling
    * Naming: attachments are managers/glue vs first-class values like fields 
        * Deniz: Attachment is a Manager ( Costume Manager vs Hat ), So maybe using the attachment proposal but naming it an extension can be a better choice. Attachment gives me a different feeling to me 
    * Access control / reference kind (auth)
        * Not in the proposal
        * Currently non-auth reference, for owned and non-owned case
        * Iterating has this problem: &AnyAttachment + reflection

* Next steps:
    * Address expression order
    * Address naming
    * Address access control

### Add fields during contract update

* https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097

* Status: No update

* Open problems:
    * Implementation details for migration (not impossible, just needs to be laid out)

* Next steps:
    * Call?
    * Anyone else interested?

### Borrow Contract

* https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071

* Status: 
    * Waiting for assistance on Tests on the Cadence implementation side

* Open problems:
    * None

* Next steps:
    * Assist with implementation

### Change semantics of for-loops

* https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/cadence/2022-10-11-for-loop-semantics.md

* Status:
    * Ready for review

* Open problems:
    * None

* Next steps:
    * Vote!


### Change the syntax for function types

* https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/43

* Status:
    * FLIP open, ready for review

* Open problems:
    * None

* Next steps:
    * Vote!

### Interface Inheritance

* https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40

* Forum discussion: https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-interface-inheritance-in-cadence/3750

* Status:
    * FLIP opened
    * Implementation in progress
    * Sentiment is positive for need
    * Blocker is details

* Open questions:
    * How to resolve/handle conflicting default implementations?
    * Do implementations of an interface also have to explicitly specify all inherited interfaces as well?
        * Implicit or explicit conformance
            * Definitely require implementation of all interfaces, inherited or not
            * Maybe require explicit list, as acknowledgement
        * Can conflict with default method resolution
            * Related to first problem
            * Should be consistent
    * Multiple inheritance, lineralization
        * E.g. Python: C3
        * Scala, Rust: explicit order, allow disambiguation
        * Go? Struct embedding
        * Kotlin: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/interfaces.html#resolving-overriding-conflicts
    * Unique to Cadence, not in other languages: contract updatability
    * Related: Condition ordering. Basically: order of execution for code in interfaces
        * Conditions are view functions, so order "doesn't matter", but still needs to be deterministic (for reads, errors)

* Next steps:
    * Resolve open problems
    * Document behaviour for current interface default functions => separate discussion
    * Maybe have breakout session to speed up
        * Who wants to join the discussion?
            * Josh, Satyam, Austin, Bjarte


### Extend transaction format

* https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41

* TLDR:
    * Use-case: UA should allow users to choose e.g. storage location, etc.
    * Broad scope / far-reaching (Cadence, UA, SDKs, etc.)
        * Cadence: Multiple prepare blocks, field annotations ("roles"), multiple post blocks 
    * Benefits: Composition, safety

* Status:
    * FLIP open, looking for initial feedback

* Open problems:
    * Not attached to particular solution
    * Complexity (many additions in multiple areas)
    * Code generation functionality

* Notes:
    * Related to account initialization
    * Austin will reach out to Jeff to align both efforts

* Next steps:
    * Needs more eyes, eventually have breakout session later

## Behaviour of `Account.keys.forEach`

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2038](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2038) 

* All keys or only revoked keys?
* Maybe indicate through naming?
* `AccountKey` has index
* User has the ability to filter revoked keys
* Currently: includes revoked keys, just like keys field
* Additional function for filtering revoked?
    * Ideally index of all non-revoked keys in FVM
* Ordering?
    * Maybe active first, revoked last
    * Would ideally also be based on index in FVM
* Concern: feels like an array, so user/dev might assume certain ordering
* Documentation should (already does?) mention order 
* Signal consideration of isRevoked by making it an additional parameter of the callback function? What about weight, that too (e.g. 0 weight)?
* (Keys are immutable, other than revocation; e.g. can't change weight)
* Next steps:
    * Leave as-is
    * Improve documentation

## Removal/reduction of nested type requirements

* Several options:
    * Reduction to just events
    * Removal; requires alternative
        * Deniz' issue: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2069
            * "Global" events
            * Could add additional information (originating contract) to global events
        * https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2081
        * https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1161
            * Use interface default function implementation
* Related: additional feature to enforcing events are emitted	
* Need to guarantee that only FTs emit events, and only "concrete" events
* Next steps:
    * Session on new standards, then have better understanding about events
        * e.g. separate vs shared event types
        * Discussion in next Smart Contract Engineering Open House
    * Evaluate options above, pros/cons

## Resolving external mutation

* https://github.com/dapperlabs/cadence-private-issues/issues/59

* Any solutions beyond the reference exploit may impact usability too negatively to be worth implementing?

* Next step:
    * Fill gap for references: dynamic check
    * Does not need FLIP
    * Maybe consider follow-up, address arbitrary mutating functions
        * Remove public fields FLIP, was rejected
            * Reconsider? Need to address outstanding problems
