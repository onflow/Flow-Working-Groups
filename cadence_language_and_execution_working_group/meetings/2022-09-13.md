## FLIPs

* **Capability Controllers:**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798) 
    * Status: Scoping
    * Open problems:
        * What parts should be part of this FLIP?
        * What should rather go in follow-up proposal(s)?
        * How to provide better and easier to understand API?
    * Next steps:
        * At least define replacement for current API
        * Solve bootstrapping problem in separate FLIP
        * Meeting

* **Add identity to AuthAccount:**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/945](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/945) 
    * Status: Closed, replaced by capability publish/claim FLIP 1122

* **Publish and Claim Capabilities**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1122](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1122)
    * Purpose: Capability bootstrapping. Replacement for FLIP 945
    * Status: New, just published
    * Open problems:
        * Only for capabilities or anything?
        * Off-chain or on-chain inspection?
        * Next steps: Clarify/resolve open problems

* **Extensibility**(see below)
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1101](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1101) 
    * Status: Impass, unclear scope/direction
    * Open problems:
        * Two different proposals with different pros/cons
(boxing/wrapping vs containment)
    * Next steps:
        * Meeting

* **Add fields during contract update:** 
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097) 
    * Status: No update
    * Open problems:
        * Implementation details for migration (not impossible, just needs to be laid out)
    * Next steps:
        * Meeting

* **Invalidate references to transferred resources:**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043)
    * Status: 
        * Agreement for need
        * Prototype implementation in progress
    * Open problems:
        * Concerns
    * Next steps:
        * Complete prototype 
        * Analyze impact

* **Borrow Contract**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071) 
    * Status: 
        * Complete
        * Needs minor edits
        * Reference implementation in progress
    * Open problems:
        * Concern that static analysis is not possible anymore resolved:    
            * Already have run-time imports of contracts
        * Concern for program cache invalidation: 
            * Implementation detail, not a concern, functionality basically already available
    * Next steps:
        * Needs approval/rejection

* **Remove public resource fields:**
    * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/739](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/739)
    * Status: No progress
    * Open problems: None
    * Next steps: Dete 

* **Purity/mutability analysis:**
   * [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1056](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1056)
    * Status: Accepted ðŸŽ‰

## Extensions

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/357](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/357)
* Context
    * Long-requested feature: Add functionality and data to existing types, after the fact, without work from author of type. Controlled by user
    * Prior community effort: [https://forum.onflow.org/t/extensibility/622](https://forum.onflow.org/t/extensibility/622)
* Open Questions:
    * What are the use-cases that should be covered?
    * Do we need to add support for extending fields?
        * This significantly complicates extensions by requiring them to define new (or partial) initializers for their new data
    * How limiting would it be to restrict extensions to be used only one at a time?
        * Otherwise we need to consider how to handle extensions with overlapping data/methods. In other languages this is simple but in Cadence two extensions that define the same type but use it differently would be a security issue
    * How can the same type interact with differently extended versions of itself? Can a CryptoKitty with a hat be used in places where only a CryptoKitty is expected? Can a CryptoKitty with a hat and a scarf be used as if it only had a scarf?

## Account Storage Delta (hash)

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1777](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1777)

* Determine change on-chain was as expected

* Accessible on-chain

* Dry run: run transaction as script, get hash

* Run transaction, ensure hash in post-condition

* Related to iteration: detect invalidation due to mutation

* Hash should be cheap, needs to be cheaper than comparison

* Feedback:

    * Storage changes are not immediately effective, serialization is lazy
(end of transaction)

    * But: storageUsed materializes cache

    * Potential problem: more modifications after transaction end

    * Hash of what? Full account? All accounts? Just part of an accountâ€™s storage?

    * Can we use state proofs?

* Next steps:

    * Ping FVM team

    * Atree/State trie additions? Ask Ramtin, Faye

    * Keep discussion in Github issue, determine details

    * â†’ propose FLIP once clear how to implement

## Prevent re-entrancy attacks

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1543](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1543)

* Large topic, low priority relative to other issues

* Many different options
    * Explicit vs implicit
    * Granularity: whole type vs individual fields
    * Static vs dynamic guarantees

* Problems:
    * Learning curve
    * Ideally no-brainer or very easy to use

* Ideas:
    * Rust/Ocaml ref-cells
    * Make cross-contract calls promises / asynchronous
        * Async prepares for sharding in future
        * Examples: Swiftâ€™s new actor system, Agoric, etc.
        * JS developers still try to understand promises
        * Does not handle all cases
        * Implicit / hidden

## Extend character set of identifier part in paths

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/419](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/419)
* Allowing dots is parsing problems (conflict with field access)

## Alternative to paths: Resolver functions

* Not addressing by path, but by type (used to have this early on)
* What if multiple elements for one type? Array? Identifier?
* Resolver function for a type/name pair. E.g. FT + "default"
* For / instead of public domain
* Relation to capability controllers:
    * Gets rid of private paths, not paths in general
    * Could make use of this feature

* Next steps:
    * What use-cases/problems does this solve?
    * Comparison to existing system
    * Pros/cons 

## Initialization problem

* Context
    * How to ensure proper setup? e.g. linking, initialization of storage
    * Lost+Found

* Problem:
    * Have bits and pieces
    * No concrete full solution

* Related:
    * New FT + NFT standards have built-in info, collection data metadata
        * Specific to FT/NFT, not a general solution
        * Assumes collection is already stored
    * "Transaction/interaction templates" proposal
        * Setup (e.g. FT vault) + interactions (e.g. FT transfer)

* Cadence-specific ideas:
    * Scoped access to storage (e.g. by path)
    * Related to granular capabilities for AuthAccount

* Next steps:
    * Create issue, not a FLIP yet

## Error messages of assert/pre/post are eagerly evaulated 

* [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1838](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1838)

* Should go into Stable Cadence

* Encourage error messages

* Workaround create custom wrapper: 
assert(true, message: lazyMessage: ((): String)?)
