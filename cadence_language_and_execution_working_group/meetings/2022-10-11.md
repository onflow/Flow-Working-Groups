## FLIPs

### Capability Controllers

* [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798)
* Status:
    * Ready for approval
    * Hardest problem was bootstrapping, solved by publish/claim
    * Want to potentially explore backward compatibility
* Open problems:
    * Could emulate proposal / or existing API
    * How to have both at the same time
* Next steps:
    * Determine backward compatibility
    * Other than that, ready to move to decision, mostly agreement
    * Could maybe consider adjust proposal to allow for backward-compatibility

### Extensibility

* [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1101](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1101)
* [https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2)
* Status:
    * Alternatively: [Attachments FLIP](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/11)
        * FLIP discussions now in forum: [https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645)
        * More dynamic, little static typing
        * Benefits:
            * Not prone to breakage on contract updates
        * Disadvantages:
            * Less ergonomic, less powerful
* Open problems:
    * None (?) in both
* Next steps:
    * Review/compare two FLIPs, make decisions on what matters
    * Both doable, static slightly more work
    * Most important is UX/use-cases for developers
        * Attachments proposal matches more closely use-cases (?)
        * Static guarantees / implicitness better
        * Extensions proposal provides more static guarantees
            * Extension can statically state requirements (type)
            * Often more, dynamic requirements
            * Can restrict which code can create instances
                * Usually instantiation is unrestricted, it’s acceptance which is limited
                * Openness VS security foot-gun
            * Prefer openness
        * Extensions more powerful, but also more complex
        * Attachments simpler, covers less use-cases, but more common one

### Add fields during contract update

* [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1097)
* Status: No update
* Open problems:
    * Implementation details for migration (not impossible, just needs to be laid out)
* Next steps:
    * Call?

### Invalidate references to transferred resources

* [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1043)
* Status:
    * Ready for decision
    * Implementation mostly ready ([https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1999](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1999))
        * Initially only planned dynamic checks
        * Also added static checks to prevent bugs/problems early
            * Static checks cover most use-cases discovered during analysis of Mainnet contracts
* Open problems:
    * None
* Next steps:
    * Make a decision, mostly agreement

### Borrow Contract

* [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1071)
* Status:
    * Complete
    * Have reference implementation ([https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1934](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1934))
        * Needs some assistance on e.g. tests
    * FLIP is up-to-date
* Open problems:
    * Concern that static analysis is not possible anymore resolved, already have run-time imports of contracts
    * Concern for cache invalidation – implementation detail, not a concern, functionality basically already available
* Next steps:
    * Needs approval/rejection

### Enforcing events / nested type requirements

* We would like to remove the nested type requirements feature from Cadence
* However, the new FT/NFT standards plan to keep using the feature for enforcing the declaration of event
* Can we find an alternative to enforcing events without using nested type requirements?
    * Events as nested type requirements are mostly just boilerplate
    * Concrete type "needs" separate events, cannot emit events from interface
    * Definitions in concrete type are not "useful" right now, cannot enforce they are emitted in a certain way
    * Maybe just "inherit" event types from interface
        * Feedback: Too implicit
    * Contract-level events -> requires type field
        * Maybe move events to resource-level, i.e. FT/NFT itself?
    * Changing events significantly will affect existing off-chain systems
    * Emit event always in post-condition of interface
        * Currently (potentially unnecessarily) limited by new view-functions feature (conditions are view contexts)
        * Requires allowing definition of concrete events in interfaces
    * Might be easier to have "universal" event types with type field, instead of separate ones
    * Related: filtering on API
* If we can't remove nested type requirements, can we maybe at least reduce the feature to just events? Only using the feature for events addresses at least some of the concerns we have with the feature, and we can still simplify the codebase a bit
* Next steps:
    * Write example standard and derive required language changes (Deniz and Bjarte will look into it)

### Additional Storage API functions

* `clear`: [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1253](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1253)
    * `fun clear(_ path: Path): Bool`
    * Reason: sugar/helper
    * This function deletes whatever is present at the specified path, destroying any resources, and returns whether anything was present originally.
    * Concerns: implicitness, destruction without destroy
    * Maybe name "destroyAt"
* `forceSave`: [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1252](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1252)
    * `fun forceSave<T>(_ value: T, to path: Path): Bool`
    * This will save a value to the specified path, overwriting any data present (and destroying it if it is a resource). Returns whether or not any data was overwritten
    * Reason: save fails when value exists
    * Concerns: destruction without destroy
    * Maybe name "destroyAndSave"
* Functionality exists already
* Prefer explicitness / keyword (enforce one way)
* Main use-case: avoiding path collisions
* Related: Removal of storage paths (replace with type + name pair)
* Concern: streamlining pattern we do not want to encourage
* → Put on pause until we discussed path changes

### Alternative to paths

* FLIP draft: [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1130](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/1130)
* Cap Cons:
    * Remove private (no longer needed, were only used for caps)
    * Public for capabilities
* Problems with paths:
    * Collisions
    * Most common use-case: one value per type
* Type + name pair
* Problem:
    * borrow can be for interface
* Idea/goal for paths:
    * User’s account is controlled by user, UA mediates
    * Dapp/contracts should not dictate
    * Common user just has one value (e.g. default FT vault, NFT collection)
    * Power users might have multiple (e.g. multiple FT vaults, NFT collections, for different purposes. Cf. checking vs savings account)
    * Not (yet) a reality today, didn’t have necessary functionality
    * Efforts:
        * Interaction template library: Allow UA to inject path
    * New proposal does not hinder the goal (right?)
    * Goal requires introspection
* Path/name choosing, mediated by UA
* Related: account initialization (call on 2022-10-18)
* Application "state" in user account VS user data stored in user account
    * Analogies:
        * Windows Programs directory vs documents directory
        * Mac/*nix /home vs /lib
* Interoperability easier with user-managed/stored data
* Next steps: continue discussion
    * How does the proposal solve the problems?
    * ?

### Publish/claim capability use-cases?

* Bootstrapping
* Outline ideal use-case
* Existing pattern of private push-inbox, in our case pull
    * Example: n email inbox where emails are pushed through the inbox and handled according to rules (rate limiting, requiring payment or anti-sybil proof)[ https://petmail.lothar.com/design.html](https://petmail.lothar.com/design.html)
* Update best practices page
* Next step: Write up, discuss (Kate)
