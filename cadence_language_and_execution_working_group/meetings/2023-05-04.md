## FLIPs

### Capability Controllers

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798](https://github.com/onflow/flow/pull/798)

* Status:
    * Final API adjustments
    * Implementation nearing completion
    * No remaining concerns

* Open problems:
    * None

* Next steps:
    * Update FLIP, no capcons for links
    * Migration, rollout documentation
    * Documentation around pattern (e.g. getCapability to construct, link later)
    * Clarify migration: find storage path, storage path does not need to store anything
    * **Accept, unless objections**

### Entitlements and Safe Downcasting

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/54)

* Status:
    * Implementation done
    * No remaining concerns
    * Additional features requested â†’ follow-up FLIPs

* Open problems/concerns:
    * Complexity
        * Parts: entitlements, downcasting, mappings
    * Syntax (comma, and, set)
    * Migration?
        * Current access control pattern: public declaration, *but* restricted type to gate access
        * Maybe get rid of pub and priv?
        * Type in existing capability
        * Breakage is OK, security problem not. Maybe have contract be broken until fixed

* Next steps:
    * Details for migration, maybe breakout session
    * Documentation and tutorials, for existing and new developers
        * Demonstrate with e.g. AuthAccount/PublicAccount, standard library (arrays, dictionaries, etc.), FT, NFT, etc.
    * Preview release for Stable Cadence: Emulator, Playground, etc.
    * **Accept, unless objections**
    * Maybe propose removal of restricted types, not "necessary" or very useful anymore

### Attachments

* Forum discussion: [https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-cadence-extensions-attachments/3645/2)

* Status:
    * Approved and merged ðŸŽ‰
    * Deployed to Testnet
    * Receiving feedback
    * Discovering use-cases
    * Need mitigation for trolling attack
    * Mainnet blocked on solution for trolling attack
    * Had breakout session for trolling attack
    * Have idea for solution, but might depend on breaking change (Stable Cadence)

* Open problem:
    * Trolling attack, blocking. Working on solution

* Next steps:
    * Address trolling attack
    * Breakout session for contexts ("try-catch") in public

### Interface Inheritance

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40)

* Forum discussion: [https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-interface-inheritance-in-cadence/3750](https://forum.onflow.org/t/flip-interface-inheritance-in-cadence/3750)

* Status:
    * Had more breakout sessions, ironed out almost all last questions/problems
    * Implementation available

* Open questions/concerns:
    * Explicit declaration of inherited interfaces?
    * Declaration (conformance list)
    * Also in restricted types? Subtyping relationship â†’ clarify in FLIP
    * No tooling required when reading contract
    * Also helps author
    * Verbosity / explicitness vs conciseness / implicitness
    * Example: FT

* Next steps:
    * Resolve last question/concern
    * **Accept, unless objections**

### Extend transaction format

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/41)

* Status:
    * No updates at the moment
    * Last breakout session was a while back
    * Planning to restart working group

* Open problems:
    * Unexplored corner:
        * Useful for multi-sign use-cases
        * Does model also make sense for single-sign use-cases?
    * Signer assignment
        * Mapping signatures to roles
        * Currently Flow transaction signatures are sequential
    * Action-based model?

* Next steps:
    * Have another breakout session
    * Contact Jeff

### External Mutability

* [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/58](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/58)

* [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/59](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/59)

* Status
    * Had more breakout session
    * Working on comparison and examples

* Open problems:
    * Usability
        * FLIPs have different compromises

* Next steps:
    * Comparison of different solutions and examples
    * Another breakout session

### Interface Conformance Improvements

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83)

* Overview:
    * Relaxation of existing restriction for interface conformance
    * Default function in one interface + Conditions in another interface is currently rejected
    * Proposal is to relax restriction and allow this case, given there is no conflict

* Open problem:
    * Conditions may currently have side-effects
    * Delay until Stable Cadence?

* Status:
    * Discuss and approve asynchronous

## Questions

* Can/should we maybe wipe Testnet?
    * Many broken/stale accounts and contracts
    * Hadnâ€™t come up before
    * Maybe suggest, e.g. in GitHub discussions and/or forum
    * Big disruption for some users
    * Iteration broken (but shouldnâ€™t be)
    * More realistic? There will be always broken code / accounts etc
        * Want to be able to test if dapp works with broken
        * Testnet is "staging" for Mainnet
        * Cannot wipe Mainnet
    * After Stable Cadence, should be less of an issue
    * Maybe FLIP? "Governance"?
    * Should be able to force delete broken values (--> force delete problem, see above: attachment trolling problem)
