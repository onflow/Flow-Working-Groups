**Dev Tools Working Group**  
Wed. Feb 14, 2024

**Summary:**  
The meeting covered several topics related to the ongoing Cadence upgrade. Ali Serag provided an update on the user experience working group's objectives, which include ensuring a seamless upgrade process, improving data accessibility on-chain, and bringing EVM to flow for access to popular EVM tools. Giovanni Sanchez led a discussion on the contract staging process, emphasizing the need for a seamless migration to the network and the importance of staging and validation metrics for understanding network health during migration. The meeting also covered the ongoing enhancements to the cadence linting tool, the implementation of a custom GPT using OpenAI's Assistant API for Cadence migration, and the validation of staged contracts.

The team discussed the need for a smooth transition to the Cadence upgrade and outlined the steps involved in the contract staging process. They also discussed potential solutions to issues with Cadence tooling on Macs with Apple Silicon and the implementation of a custom GPT using OpenAI's Assistant API for Cadence migration. The team emphasized the importance of generating smart contracts and building models to facilitate the transition to a new language in blockchain development. The meeting concluded with a decision to set up a recurring invite for future meetings.

**Contract Staging Process Demo**  

Giovanni Sanchez presents a demo of the contract staging process, focusing on the steps involved in updating and validating contracts for seamless migration to the network. He explains the use of Flix to query and stage the contract update, emphasizing the significance of staging and validation metrics for network health during migration.

**Discussion on Flix and CLI Integration**  
Giovanni Sanchez shares the status update of his migration contract staging and the use of Flix for executing queries, while Chase Fleming discusses the development of CLI to run commands conveniently. Ian Pun mentions the solidification of CLI flow and commands with Chase and Jordan, emphasizing the primary idea behind the CLI bit.

**Staging and Unstaging Contracts**  

Ian Pun details the process of staging and unstaging contracts, highlighting the steps involved in checking the contract status and obtaining the code from the flow JSON. Giovanni Sanchez raises a question about the necessity of a contract address, and Jordan Ribbink emphasizes the ease of the process for developers who have previously deployed their projects through the Flow CLI. Navid TehraniFar raises a concern about the potential for unauthorized staging of contracts, prompting a discussion on the need for verification of contract ownership.

**Discussion on Validation and Testing Frameworks**  
Giovanni Sanchez and Tom Haile address the address query issue and inquire about the protocol side's plans for validation and updating the dashboard for smart contract developers. Greg Santos provides information on the frequency of validating stage contracts on testnet, and Tom discusses the testing framework migration to Cadence.

**Enhancements to Cadence Linting Tool**  
Jordan Ribbink presents the ongoing efforts to improve the cadence linting tool, aiming to provide more detailed error diagnostics and quick fixes for common issues in smart contract transactions and script upgrades in Cadence. The team is also working on integrating the linter natively into the CLI, allowing users to run it as a standalone tool. Additionally, the enhancements will be available in VS Code, the Playground, and the CLI, with the changes currently in the CodeReview stage.

**Discussion on Mac Silicone Compatibility with Cadence Tooling**  

Tom Haile sought feedback and topics for discussion, leading to Brian Pistone's inquiry about issues with Cadence tooling on Macs with Apple Silicon. Jordan Ribbink offered potential solutions and mentioned ongoing work to resolve installation conflicts, while Tom Haile mentioned a video on pulling down the Cadence 1.0 emulator version.

**Discussion on Custom GPT for Cadence Migration**  
Tom Haile, Giovanni Sanchez, and Navid TehraniFar engage in a discussion about the development and potential applications of a custom GPT for Cadence migration. They explore the features and limitations of the tool, emphasizing the importance of user feedback to improve its accuracy and functionality. Additionally, they touch upon the integration of GPT with other tools and the potential for future enhancements in the context of blockchain development.

**Discussion on Validation of Staged Contracts and Next Steps**  
Tom Haile, Ali Serag, and other speakers discuss the validation of staged contracts, the need for local ability to stage and migrate, and the testing framework. They also highlight the key takeaways from the meeting, including the need to put in a PR or issue to Flow CLI for any issues and the frequency of future meetings.

- Local staging and migration testing

**Action Items:**  
- Ali Serag will set up a recurring invite for the next meeting
- Giovanni Sanchez will execute a staging transaction against testnet using Flix and run it on testnet.
- Giovanni Sanchez will execute a transaction on testnet using Flix.
- Greg Santos will gather feedback on the need to test the staging and migration locally
- Navid TehraniFar will work on clustering active smart contracts by similarity and template contracts
