Giovanni Sanchez explained the limitations of injecting from EVM to cadence and suggested creating an issue or chiming in on the Flow EVM Discord channel for desired features. Akos Erdos discussed the Flix working group's efforts to store metadata and transaction information on-chain, making it available to consumers and providing decentralized distribution of transaction templates. Tom Haile expressed interest in ensuring users have access to the latest version of Flix, and Giovanni Sanchez highlighted the potential role of Flowser in interacting with contracts and the need for type safety in Flix.

Giovanni Sanchez discussed the process of NFT serialization and demonstrated a script for bridging metadata from Cadence into EVM. Tom Haile inquired about support for owning other assets in 1155, and Giovanni explained the decision to focus on 721 and ERC20 standards for now. Chase Fleming provided updates on the Dependency Manager, including a new feature that allows for automatic addition to deployment accounts. Tom Haile inquired about the ease of forking testnets or mainnets using the Flow CLI, and Chase mentioned the need for documentation on this feature.

Tom Haile and Jordan Ribbink provided updates on tool integration, including changes to VS code for easier CLI switching and the addition of guardrails to the staging functionality. They discussed the limitations of contract changes and the need for soft checks to catch simple errors. Ali Serag led a discussion on the audit of core developer platforms and their upgrade to Cadence 1.0 status, seeking feedback from the team, particularly Deniz Mert Edincik, on the status of various platforms. Deniz Mert Edincik provided detailed updates on the upgrade of platforms to PreviewNet and mentioned working on new projects, including the development of new runners.

Finally, Greg Santos suggested giving another blast about the initial migration and getting immediate feedback by having some contract stages. Tom Haile planned a tentative migration test for April 3rd and encouraged suggestions for smart contracts that would facilitate development. Akos Erdos raised the possibility of using his AST walker in TypeScript for the project, emphasizing its potential value for migration tooling.

Deniz Mert Edincik outlined the difficulties encountered with NFT interface changes and migration, particularly in the checker's ability to suggest changes and errors. Tom Haile and other participants acknowledged the need for a methodical approach to address these challenges and stress the importance of open sourcing repos for community contributions.


Chapters & Topics:

Tools and Migration Status Update
Tom Haile outlines the main focuses for the upcoming cycle, which include the Crescendo upgrade and Kingsway migration status. He also seeks input on contract migration tools and invites Giovanni Sanchez to provide a status update on the bridge integration, highlighting the progress made on PRs and the timeline for the bridge deployment.
* Contract Migration Tools
* EVM Cadence Integration

Discussion on Bridging Functionality and Randomness Injection
Giovanni explains that the bridging functionality is mostly cadence-based, allowing for the deposit and transfer of NFTs and fungible tokens. Tom raises questions about randomness on the EVM side and the potential for injecting randomness from the cadence side, leading to a discussion on the pattern of offering functionality in cadence and exposing it to the EVM side.

EVM Cadence Integration Discussion
Tom Haile facilitates a discussion on EVM cadence integration, with Akos Erdos inquiring about RLP encoding functionality on the EVM side. Giovanni Sanchez clarifies the directional limitations between cadence and EVM and suggests exploring the possibility of implementing desired features in Cadence through the Flow EVM Discord channel.

On-chain Flix and Community Tools Updates
Akos Erdos provides an overview of the Flix working group's focus on storing transaction templates on an on-chain registry for decentralized distribution. Tom Haile raises the issue of ensuring users have access to the latest version of Flix, and Giovanni Sanchez discusses the potential role of Flowser in interacting with contracts and the need for type safety in Flix, including the development of TypeScript wrappers for FCL to run Flix.
* Community Tools Updates

Discussion on NFT Serialization and EVM Cadence Integration
Giovanni Sanchez presents a script for bridging metadata from Cadence into EVM and demonstrates the NFT serialization process. Tom Haile asks about support for owning other assets in 1155, and Giovanni explains the decision to focus on 721 and ERC20 standards due to the absence of an analogous standard in Cadence for semi-fungible assets.

Dependency Manager and FCL Integration
Chase Fleming discusses the new feature in the Dependency Manager that allows for automatic addition to deployment accounts, while Tom Haile raises questions about forking testnets or mainnets using the Flow CLI. Deniz Mert Edincik shares insights on the possibility of simulating transactions on the real network and the challenges in integrating it with FCL due to changes in the environment.
* Dependency Manager Updates

Status Updates and Tool Integration
Tom Haile seeks a status update from Jordan Ribbink on the pending PRs for Lintern integration and VS code changes. Jordan discusses the changes made to VS code for easier CLI switching and the addition of guardrails to the staging functionality, emphasizing the need for soft checks to catch simple errors in contracts due to limitations on state migration.

Status of Core Developer Platforms
Ali Serag discusses the audit of core developer platforms and their upgrade to Cadence 1.0 status, seeking input from the team, especially Deniz Mert Edincik, on the status of various platforms. Deniz Mert Edincik provides updates on the upgrade of platforms to PreviewNet and mentions working on new projects as well.
* Flix Status and Integration

Tool Improvement Suggestions and Migration Planning
Greg Santos raises the idea of giving another blast about the initial migration and getting immediate feedback by having some contract stages. Tom Haile plans a tentative migration test for April 3rd and encourages suggestions for smart contracts that would facilitate development, urging the team to discuss and throw in ideas in the Discord for further consideration.

Discussion on AST Walker and Cadence Parser
Akos Erdos inquired about the potential use of his AST walker in TypeScript for the project, explaining its relevance to migration tooling. Jordan Ribbink highlighted the availability of the Cadence parser in WASM build and its use for walking abstract syntax trees. Deniz Mert Edincik provided background on his attempt to write a converter for stable cadence for 1.0.

Challenges with NFT Interface Changes and Migration
Deniz Mert Edincik expresses the complexities of NFT interface changes and migration, emphasizing the challenges with the checker suggesting changes and errors. Tom Haile and others recognize the need for a structured approach and encourage open sourcing repos for community involvement in addressing the migration issues.


Action Items:

* Giovanni Sanchez will ensure that there are the features required to build sufficient tests between Cadence and an EVM contract integration.
* Akos Erdos will make his cadence smart contract to do the encoding of the information needed to encode and then work from there.
* Tom Haile will get the tools situated and provide a status update, then figure out the next steps.
* Deniz Mert Edincik will upgrade the FDNS at Run.DNZ when time allows, which should be a quick process.
* Identify gaps and hangups in the migration process and create issues to address them.


Key Questions:

* What is the breakdown of solidity and cadence in the whole bridge?
* Would the bridge be able to offer randomness on the EVM side, or would it have to be baked in through more of a protocol level side?
* Is there an RLP encoding functionality on the EVM side that can be leveraged on the Cadence side as well?
