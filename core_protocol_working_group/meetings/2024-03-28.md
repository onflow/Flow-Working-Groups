# Inaugural Meeting [00] of the Core Protocol Working Group

**Date**: March 28, 2024 (Thursday), 10-11am PT

## Agenda 
1. [Path to Zero-downtime protocol upgrades](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades):

   We start this meeting with Yurii briefly summarizing the `Key-Value Store`'s central abilities and his thoughts on coordinating software upgrades without sporks.

   _Recap:_ In the last meeting ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VSnVyZpxQuNhbqB_UFlG-_Im78G_yvod/view?usp=drive_link)) Yurii introduced
   the [Dynamic Protocol State](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#dynamic-protocol-state-as-a-foundation-for-threat-response-capabilities-eg-ban-slashed-node-revoke-compromised-keys-software-upgrades).
   In a nutshell, the Protocol State is an API in the node software, which allows higher-level protocol logic to get various data about the known blocks and forks,
   such as their finalization and sealing state, which nodes are allowed to participate as of a certain block, and supplemental information about the state of the Epoch switchover.
   The old Protocol State was a very static shortcut, which could not change throughout an epoch. For security reasons, such as ejection of byzantine nodes, this was insufficient.    
   The new Dynamic Protocol State will reach Mainnet at the next Network Upgrade. Specifically, the Dynamic Protocol State includes a framework for embedding structured data into each block,
   for storing a snapshot of protocol-defined parameters and supplemental protocol-data. Correct evolution of this data store is guaranteed by BFT consensus.
   Yurii explained how the Epoch-switchover already utilizes the Dynamic-Protocol-State's ability to embed a cryptographic commitment of structured data into each block,
   and to evolve this data according to custom logic. We are currently generalizing this feature into a `Key-Value Store` and making it available as a tool for many areas of the flow protocol.      

2. Entry discussion on **HCU-style upgrades for all node roles**

   This will likely require follow-up meetings in a focused sub-working-group. Everyone is welcome with the interest to go technically deep and shaping the next level of flow protocol updates!  

3. Brief overview of **Tuning Flow's Main Consensus** :point_right: [technical exploration](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Cruise-Control-headroom-for-speedups-46dc17e07ae14462b03341e4432a907d?pvs=4) (according to available time)
   
   Proposing a concrete parameter set will likely require a dedicated sub-working-group.

## Meeting Content

### 1. Key-Value Store for coordinating software upgrades without sporks

> proposal from Yurii Oleksyshyn


### 2. HCU-style upgrades for all node roles

#### Status Quo
Strong limitations of existing Height-Coordinated Updates [HCU] for Execution Nodes [ENs]
1. Only implemented for ENs
2. Requires time-sensitive (manual) coordination upfront and node operator standby during HCU
3. One-time event that all affected nodes need to observe

   Failure scenario:
    * HCU event emitted before Epoch switchover, new node joins at epoch

4. HCU mechanism only specifies minimum software version at specific block boundary (but not max).
   Only safe if all updates are 100% downwards compatible.

   Failure scenario:
    * Operator brings up node from recent historical state (pre-HCU)
    * Uses latest EN image (post HCU)
      => software is happy and produces possibly wrong results

#### Short-term goals
_Reduced_ downtime from protocol upgrades by
* (i) extending and refining the HCU mechanism to allow upgrades to all node roles (remove limitation 1)
    * focus on algorithmic upgrades
    * first step enable upgrades that do _not_ require a database migration (no changes to persisted data structures)
* (ii) supporting rolling upgrades that do not require nodes to reboot in a time-coordinated manner (remove limitation 2)
* (iii) significantly increasing robustness of upgrade process and remove protocol-version ambiguity for later data processing (remove limitation 3)

#### [ToDo] Arrange sub-working-group

### 3. Tuning Flow's Main Consensus
* [technical exploration](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Cruise-Control-headroom-for-speedups-46dc17e07ae14462b03341e4432a907d?pvs=4) (according to available time)

* **[ToDo] Arrange sub-working-group**
