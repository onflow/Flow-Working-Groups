### 2. Upcoming priorities and midterm focus

#### Upcoming priorities:
* [Path to Zero-downtime protocol upgrades](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades)
* Translate performance improvements from new BLST-based cryptography stack to consensus block rate increase ( :point_right: issue [#5302](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5302))
* [Recovering from Epoch-Fallback Mode (EFM) without requiring a Spork](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#recovering-from-epoch-fallback-mode-without-requiring-a-spork)

#### Mid-term focus:
* [Permissionless participation of Consensus Nodes and resulting BFT requirements](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#permissionless-participation-of-consensus-nodes-and-resulting-bft-requirements)
* [Scaling the State to Terabytes (single snapshot)](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#scaling-the-state-to-terabytes-single-snapshot)




### 3. [Path to Zero-downtime protocol upgrades](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades)

#### Context
1. Why does Flow have to undergo upgrades?
   * Protocol implementation not yet fully complete. Removing shortcuts are often breaking changes.
   * Allowing for breaking software upgrades without downwards compatability (previously called 'Spork'):
     - massively simplifies evolution of software design
     - drastically reduces code maintenance cost and code readability
     - significantly reduces code complexity and interdependency, ergo protocol safety 

     â‡’ enables rapid evolution of protocol implementation

2. Our journey so far:
   - We started with 8 sporks a year.
   - In 2023, we had 4 sporks (one every quarter) and 99.9% overall uptime.
   - In 2024, our goal is to only need one protocol upgrade requiring downtime (spork).

     The major storage optimization (aka 'Atree register inlining') will require some downtime for 
     state migration, which we hope to compensate for by enabling rolling upgrades in other protocol areas   

#### Status Quo
Strong limitations of existing Height-Coordinated Updates [HCU] for Execution Nodes [ENs]
1. Only implemented for ENs
2. Requires time-sensitive (manual) coordination upfront and node operator standby during HCU
3. One-time event that all affected nodes need to observe

   Failure scenario:
    * HCU event emitted before Epoch switchover, new node joins at epoch

4. HCU mechanism only specifies minimum software version at specific block boundary (but not max).
   Only safe if all updates are 100% downwards compatible.

   Failure scenario:
    * Operator brings up node from recent historical state (pre-HCU)
    * Uses latest EN image (post HCU)
      => software is happy and produces possibly wrong results

#### Short-term goals
_Reduced_ downtime from protocol upgrades by
* (i) extending and refining the HCU mechanism to allow upgrades to all node roles (remove limitation 1)
    * focus on algorithmic upgrades
    * first step enable upgrades that do _not_ require a database migration (no changes to persisted data structures)
* (ii) supporting rolling upgrades that do not require nodes to reboot in a time-coordinated manner (remove limitation 2)
* (iii) significantly increasing robustness of upgrade process and remove protocol-version ambiguity for later data processing (remove limitation 3)     


**Foundational framework: [Dynamic Protocol State](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#dynamic-protocol-state-as-a-foundation-for-threat-response-capabilities-eg-ban-slashed-node-revoke-compromised-keys-software-upgrades)**

> Today: Introductory talk by Yurii Oleksyshyn

- Next Core Protocol Working Group meeting: start discussing how we utilize the dynamic protocol state for HCU-style software upgrades  


## Key Outcomes

We built a shared understanding what the [Dynamic Protocol State](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#dynamic-protocol-state-as-a-foundation-for-threat-response-capabilities-eg-ban-slashed-node-revoke-compromised-keys-software-upgrades)
and the foundational abilities it unlocks for the protocol.
This provides the necessary technical background to discuss how to design HCU-style software upgrades utilizing the dynamic protocol state.
