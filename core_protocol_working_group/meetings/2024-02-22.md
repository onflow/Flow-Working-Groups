#### 2. Upcoming priorities and midterm focus

* **Upcoming priorities:**
    * [Path to Zero-downtime protocol upgrades](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades)
    * Translate performance improvements from new BLST-based cryptography stack to consensus block rate increase ( :point_right: issue [#5302](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5302))
    * [Recovering from Epoch-Fallback Mode (EFM) without requiring a Spork](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#recovering-from-epoch-fallback-mode-without-requiring-a-spork)

* **Mid-term focus:**
    * [Permissionless participation of Consensus Nodes and resulting BFT requirements](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#permissionless-participation-of-consensus-nodes-and-resulting-bft-requirements)
    * [Scaling the State to Terabytes (single snapshot)](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#scaling-the-state-to-terabytes-single-snapshot)




#### 3.  [Path to Zero-downtime protocol upgrades](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades)
**Short-term goals:** _reduced_ downtime from protocol upgrades

**Status Quo:**
Strong limitations of existing Height-Coordinated Updates [HCU] for Execution Nodes [ENs]
1. Only implemented for ENs
2. Requires time-sensitive (manual) coordination upfront and node operator standby during HCU
3. One-time event that all affected nodes need to observe

   Failure scenario:
    * HCU event emitted before Epoch switchover, new node joins at epoch

4. HCU mechanism only specifies minimum software version at specific block boundary (but not max).
   Only safe if all updates are 100% downwards compatible.

   Failure scenario:
    * Operator brings up node from recent historical state (pre-HCU)
    * Uses latest EN image (post HCU)
      => software is happy and produces possibly wrong results

#### Next Goals
* (i) to extend and refine the HCU mechanism to allow upgrades to all node roles (remove limitation 1)
   * focus on algorithmic upgrades 
   * first step enable upgrades that do _not_ require a database migration (no changes to persisted data structures)
* (ii) support rolling upgrades that do not require nodes to reboot in a time-coordinated manner (remove limitation 2)
* (iii) significantly increase robustness of upgrade process and remove protocol-version ambiguity for later data processing (remove limitation 3)     


**Foundational framework: [Dynamic Protocol State](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#dynamic-protocol-state-as-a-foundation-for-threat-response-capabilities-eg-ban-slashed-node-revoke-compromised-keys-software-upgrades)**

> Today: Introductory talk by Yurii Oleksyshyn

- Next Core Protocol Working Group meeting: start discussing how we utilize the dynamic protocol state for HCU-style software upgrades  


## Key Outcomes

We built a shared understanding what the [Dynamic Protocol State](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#dynamic-protocol-state-as-a-foundation-for-threat-response-capabilities-eg-ban-slashed-node-revoke-compromised-keys-software-upgrades)
and the foundational abilities it unlocks for the protocol.
This provides the necessary technical background to discuss how to design HCU-style software upgrades utilizing the dynamic protocol state.
