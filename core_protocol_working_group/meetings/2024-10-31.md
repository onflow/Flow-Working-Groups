## Meeting Content

* discussed terminology and approach for versioning, based on the draft (in notion): 
  [Core Protocol WG Meeting 07 [October 31, 2024]: Flip Proposal to Utilize Dynamic Protocol State for Version Beacon](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Core-Protocol-WG-Meeting-07-October-31-2024-1271aee1232480d0850eced4fafc1596?pvs=4)
* Based on the results of our discussion, we have created [FLIP 296: Utilize Dynamic Protocol State for Version Beacon (coordinating upgrades of the Execution Stack)](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/version-beacon-flip_initial-draft/protocol/20241031-execution-stack-versioning.md)


## Key Outcomes [proposal, subject to edits during Working Group Meeting]

* We will focus on **transitioning the _existing Version Beacon_ to utilize the Dynamic Protocol State**.
  In essence, we want to avoid extending the old upgrade mechanism in a way that is incompatible with the Dynamic Protocol State
  and needing to be rewritten later. As part of this, we will address known limitations of the existing  Version Beacon
  (see [FLIP 296](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/version-beacon-flip_initial-draft/protocol/20241031-execution-stack-versioning.md)
  for details)
* By utilizing the Dynamic Protocol State for upgrades, we want to generate **learnings on where the new framework should be improved**. 
* Midterm goal: utilize the **same framework** for **upgrading various parts of the protocol**, to reduce code and intellectual complexity
  that would otherwise result from using significantly different approaches.

Consolidate thoughts and flesh out proposal in a Flip - the result is already available ðŸ‘‰[FLIP 296](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/version-beacon-flip_initial-draft/protocol/20241031-execution-stack-versioning.md)

**2. Rough outline of development roadmap**

1. design doc & scope for cross HCU ANs (and EVM gateway)
2. extend Dynamic Protocol State:
   - add FVM-Cadence version field
   - new service event that specifies a new version value (to be consumed by the Dynamic Protocol State) 
   - state machine for updating version field in Dynamic Protocol State based on service event.
3. system smart contracts can emit service events that update the FVM-Cadence version in the Dynamic Protocol State
4. Re-work HCU mechanism on execution, verification and ANs to utilize Dynamic Protocol State
