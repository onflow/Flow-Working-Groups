# Meeting 14 - Core Protocol Working Group

**Date**: June 26, 2025 (Thursday), 10-11am PT (17-18:00 UTC)

## Agenda

This is a **joint** meeting with the Flow **Engineering Study Group**.
We will be discussing:
* Solana's new [Alpenglow Consensus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y_7ddr8oNOknTQYHzXeeMD2ProQ0WjMs/view) and the related body
of research (most prominently [Simplex](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/463) and [Kudzu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08771) consensus protocols).
We'll touch on the following aspects:
  * Resilience thresholds against byzantine participants and unresponsive but otherwise honest nodes
  * Finalization latency
  * Message complexity
  * Protocol complexity
  * Limitations of the protocols
* To which extent these protocols are applicable to Flow's architecture (tentative results only, more research is needed if we want to further explore using this class of algorithms in Flow). 
* Limitations of our understanding and potential future research directions.

Attendees are _not_ expected to have read the papers beforehand. Though, a basic understanding of common approaches to BFT consensus will certainly be helpful.
