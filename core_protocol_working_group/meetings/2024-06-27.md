### 1. Tagging code changes that need a Height Coordinated Upgrade (HCU)

**Context:** During our [Retro on execution fork](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Retro-on-execution-fork-01504b970441477ebfc0174d14dcb269?pvs=4)
we identified that a breaking change on the deployment branch `v0.33` was inadvertently deployed on the execution nodes causing an execution fork. 
To prevent such an incidence in the future, the branching strategy for the [flow-go](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go) repo needs to be improved.

During an internal retrospective call for this issue, two options were proposed:

1. Option 1 - The current branch should always be deployable without requiring an HCU. For any changes that require an HCU, a special branch of the current branch should be created and tagged. The newly created branch then becomes the current branch after the HCU.
e.g. Let's say the current branch is `v0.33` and the latest tag is `v0.33.36` on that branch. Now, if there are changes that require an HCU, a new branch is created off of `v0.33` called `v0.33_hcu_1` and then a new tag `v0.33.37` is created with all the changes merged into `v0.33_hcu_1`.
  
2. Option 2 - Changes that require an HCU can be merged into the current branch. The current branch can then be only deployed via an HCU. For any changes not requiring an HCU, a new branch has to be created from the current tag.

Option 1 is the simplest and safest approach but would love to hear from the group about their opinion.
