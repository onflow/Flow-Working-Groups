# Meeting 17 - Core Protocol Working Group

**Date**: Sept 25, 2025 (Thursday), 10-11am PT (17-18:00 UTC)


## Agenda: Introduction of the new storage backend and API for Flow nodes.

With the Forte upgrade, nodes on testnet now use PebbleDB to deliver better uptime, smoother operations, and lower total cost for operators. PebbleDB offers higher stability under load for our workloads compared to BadgerDB, eliminating memory spikes, effective automated pruning of historical data, a modest performance edge in typical node operations. Moreover, PebbleDB has broad ecosystem adoption that supports rapid improvements and long-term runtime reliability. In practice, these strengths translate into more scalable nodes, simpler database management, and improved ROI for operators. Following the migration, measured outcomes show significant gains: depending on node type memory usage improves by up to 80%, CPU usage drops by up to 60%, and annual disk usage is reduced by up to 30%.

This change is **important for all engineers working on or with the [`flow-go` codebase](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/)**. 

Presentation Topics:
- overview of current storage module
- differences between Badger and Pebble
- overview of new storage APIs and synchronization
