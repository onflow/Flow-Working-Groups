**Attendees:**
Alex Hentschel, Bastian MÃ¼ller, Deniz Mert Edincik, Dieter Shirley, Jan Bernatik, Jordan Schalm, Peter Argue, Tim Barry

## Meeting Content

### 1. Immutable Data Structures
:point_right: issue [#7269 Hashable Data Structures are Immutable](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7269)

### 2. State and Event Proofs for Light Clients
The question has been raised (see [discord](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/1108968095982293002/1356936442772721794) conversation)
how a light client could potentially verify a proof (provided by a third party) that some event has happened on-chain. 
The focus here is on _light clients_:
* Light clients do _not_ ingest the full blockchain history.
* They are equipped with the public keys of the consensus committee (very small data set, that changes approximately once a week for flow mainnet)

We will discuss the technical overview about [State and Event Proofs](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/State-and-Event-Proofs-1d11aee123248096975ef55b1d05bb1e?pvs=4) (notion).

## Key Outcomes

### 1. Immutable Data Structures
* we discovered that the Cadence engineering team also has some tooling to enforce immutability 
* we want to investigate to possebility of consolidating the tooling in its own repo for cadence and flow-go to import
 (it needs to be its own repo to avoid cyclic dependencies)
* Dete suggested 
  > internal tooling presentation or something at some point about this approach and how other people might be able to leverage it

### 2. State and Event Proofs for Light Clients
* Alex and Tarak will extend document [State and Event Proofs](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/State-and-Event-Proofs-1d11aee123248096975ef55b1d05bb1e?pvs=4) with more details on _root of trust_.
* details are clear enough for Deniz to attempt POC
