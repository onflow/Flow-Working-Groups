## Meeting Content

### 1. State and Event Proofs for Light Clients
The question has been raised (see [discord](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/1108968095982293002/1356936442772721794) conversation)
how a light client could potentially verify a proof (provided by a third party) that some event has happened on-chain. 
The focus here is on _light clients_:
* Light clients do _not_ ingest the full blockchain history.
* They are equipped with the public keys of the consensus committee (very small data set, that changes approximately once a week for flow mainnet)

We will discuss the technical overview about [State and Event Proofs](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/State-and-Event-Proofs-1d11aee123248096975ef55b1d05bb1e?pvs=4) (notion).
