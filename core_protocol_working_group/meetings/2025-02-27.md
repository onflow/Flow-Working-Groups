### 1. Categories of Flow Upgrades

#### Background

Currently, there are two mechanisms to roll out downward incompatible changes to node software: network upgrade (spork) and Height Coordinated Upgrade (HCU).
Network upgrade causes a network downtime while HCU does not cause any network downtime (see [here](https://developers.flow.com/networks/node-ops/node-operation/hcu#hcu-versus-spork) for more details).
However, HCUs can currently only be used for Verification and Execution nodes and not for the other node types - Collection and Consensus.

A new mechanism to upgrade all node types without causing any downtime has been implemented.
Earlier core protocol working group discussion about it can be found [here](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Working-Groups/tree/main/core_protocol_working_group#path-to-zero-downtime-protocol-upgrades) and the associated FLIPs is [FLIP 298](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/296).

_The new mechanism will allow a view based upgrade for all node types. The current method of HCU will be deprecated in favor of this new method._

#### Types of upgrade

With the introduction of this new mechanism there are now four ways to upgrade nodes on Flow as listed below.
There are three important stakeholders who should be informed about these upgrades - the flow foundation team, node operators and the community at large.
Hence, a consistent and effective naming convention for these four type of upgrade is needed.

1. **Optional Upgrade**
  - can be deployed in rolling fashion (nodes can be upgraded at different times)
  - only for changes that are _completely upwards_ and _downwards compatible_
  - node operators can opt for not deploying that change (discouraged)
  - Announcements and Coordination (by Flow Foundation):
    - message in Flow-Foundation-internal Slack channel `#flow-ops` 
    - for Node Operators: post message "Please upgrade to version x.x.x" on Discord channel [`flow-validators-announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/709812863287427103)
      and [`Node Operations` topic](https://forum.flow.com/c/node-operations/36) on Forums
    - for Community: no messaging necessary

2. **Rolling Software Upgrade**
    - can be deployed in rolling manner
    - mandatory update: within a larger time window (days or weeks), all affected nodes have to be updated or they will automatically cease to participate (enter crash loop, until updated by the operator)
    - suitable for upgrading the Execution Stack if the different behaviour can be enabled by a feature flag
    - suitable for upgrading protocol
    - Announcements and Coordination (by Flow Foundation):
        - message in Flow-Foundation-internal Slack channel `#flow-ops`
        - for Node Operators: post message "[Action required] Please upgrade to version x.x.x by zz Date" on Discord channel [`flow-validators-announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/709812863287427103)
          and [`Node Operations` topic](https://forum.flow.com/c/node-operations/36) on Forums
        - for Community: no messaging necessary

3. **_Time_ Coordinated Upgrade [TCU]** (previously called Height-Coordinated-Upgrade, aka HCU)
    - mandatory update: all affected nodes will need to be upgraded at the same block height
    - only practical for Execution Nodes [ENs] due to their small number, because EN node operators have to join a call
    - Announcements and Coordination (by Flow Foundation):
      - coordinate call for TCU with EN operators
      - message in Flow-Foundation-internal Slack channel `#flow-ops`
      - for Node Operators: post message "[Action required on zz Date] Please upgrade to version x.x.x at yy:yy UTC on zz Date" on Discord channel [`flow-validators-announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/709812863287427103)
        and [`Node Operations` topic](https://forum.flow.com/c/node-operations/36) on Forums
      - for Community: post message "TCU - transaction execution will pause for 5 minutes till the ENs restart"

4. **Major Network Upgrade** (aka spork) 
    - mandatory update for _all_ nodes in the network 
    - mostly all node operators have to join a call 
    - Announcements and Coordination (by Flow Foundation):
        - coordinate Spork meeting with all node operators
        - message in Flow-Foundation-internal Slack channel `#flow-ops`
        - for Node Operators: post message "[Action required on zz Date]  Please upgrade node at yy:yy UTC on zz Date to version that will be shared that day" on Discord channel [`flow-validators-announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/613813861610684416/709812863287427103)
          and [`Node Operations` topic](https://forum.flow.com/c/node-operations/36) on Forums
        - for Community: post message "network will be down for 30 mins"
